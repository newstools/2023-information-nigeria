The national chairperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, on Thursday, committed a blunder while speaking at the Party’s campaign rally in Kano State. Ayu, speaking on the reasons the people of the state should not vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC), at the Sani Abacha Stadium, Ayu said: “PDP has brought us shame”, but after a few seconds, he corrected himself and said “APC.” Ayu said if Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, is elected, policies that will improve the country’s economy will be implemented. “They are full of lies. They have nothing to offer the ‘talakas’ (poor) in Nigeria. We will come back. Our president, Atiku Abubakar, who you will vote to power in the next few weeks, we will rally around him. We will discuss our policies, and we will see where it is affecting you. We will make sure we implement a successful policy that will bring back Nigeria to its glory,” Ayu said.

PDP has brought us shame and we will not continue to retain them in power… APC. “Vote for PDP from top to bottom, from bottom to top; Atiku Abubakar as president.” Ayu’s goof is the latest in a string of slip-ups by presidential candidates and other parties’ stalwarts. December 13, 2022, the PDP presidential candidate, while speaking at the party’s campaign rally in Plateau state, begged the people of the state to “ensure that you vote for A… I mean PDP this time around”. Similarly, weeks before, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), had said: “God bless PD…APC.”

Former World Heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua says he has put his heart back in boxing as he prepares to face Jermaine Franklin at the O2 Arena in London on 1 April. The Briton, 33, looks for his first win since 2020 after successive defeats by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua said he was more serious than ever before about his boxing career. “I’ve always tried to make an empire but I made a conscious decision last year to put my heart into boxing and nothing else,” he said. “Throughout my career, this is probably the most serious time I’ve taken it.” READ MORE: Boxing: Anthony Joshua’s Career Is Finished If He Loses April Fight – Hearn Joshua was joined by his new coach Derrick James, with both men flying from Texas to London to attend the news conference. The two-time heavyweight world champion fights at the O2 Arena for the first time since 2016, and the first time in eight years he will not be fighting for a world title. Since his last bout at the O2, where he has fought seven times, Joshua has had the majority of his bouts at major outdoor stadiums. American Franklin, 29, is the clear underdog, just as he was when he lost to Dillian Whyte on points last December. But two demoralising defeats by Usyk have left Joshua at a crossroads in his career. “Everything I’ve been through – positive, negative – I’m using it to fuel my camp now,” he said.

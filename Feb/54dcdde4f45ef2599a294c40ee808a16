The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured that there is a system in place to deactivate the Bimodal Voter Registration System (BVAS) if compromised during the elections. Lawrence Bayode, the INEC deputy director of Information and Communications Technology, disclosed this while speaking on Channels Television’s special election programme, The 2023 Verdict, on Wednesday. Often times during elections in Nigeria, ballot boxes are usually snatched by hoodlums or gunmen to disrupt the electoral process. According to Bayode, the BVAS will be deactivated from the backend so that whoever snatched the device will not be able to manipulate votes.

When it is idle, it pushes that accreditation data to the backend.” He said if hoodlums took the device to other places where they think they can manipulate the data on the device, the polling unit officer will report the incident. “If such a thing happens, the PO reports and from the backend, that device is deactivated so that the person who took away that device will not be able to do anything with the device.” Bayode said.

According to the information reaching every related families from her parents, they didn’t know her whereabouts. But hopes were high that she will soon return. “Seeing the news about her disappearance with actual information from @gistloverblog.mediahouse is even more heartbreaking and devastating. Her parents has seen the news about their missing daughter as well as other related family members and we would solely be acting upon their decisions respectfully. “It is very sad and heartbreaking that Nigeria has once again happened to us @nigerianpolice, why are we threatened by the people that are suppose to protect us. “This is even one out of many other victims, and it is very heartbreaking that the people that are meant to protect us are the ones killing us. “This is not an individual fight, this are deep government concerns and if they care about us, they already know what to do with the news circulating the internet already. It is well with Nigeria.” Brain Jotter subsequently urged the Nigerian Police to investigate the matter and ensure that justice is served.

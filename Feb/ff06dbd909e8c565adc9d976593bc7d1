Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, has knocked the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar, over his (Atiku’s) stance on the naira crisis ravaging the country. Recall Atiku had always been in support of the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and also opposed a further extension of the February 10 deadline saying that any further extension would destroy the purpose and objective of the policy. He had beseeched the Federal Government to avoid making Nigerians scapegoats “in the ongoing battle of titans over the redesign of the naira.” However in a Facebook post on Sunday, he called on the CBN to release the new notes as “a matter of urgency”.

Reacting, Sowore in a Twitter post on Monday said, Atiku is an opportunist who thinks he can capitalise on the “poverty-inducing” naira redesign policy to win the presidential election. Sowore alleged that the naira redesign policy is fraudulent and targeted at hurting poor Nigerians. “Opportunistic @atiku thought he could capitalise on the poverty-inducing Naira Design to win election. Any real leader would have known that ‘naira design’ fraud was gonna to (going to) hurt poor Nigerians. Reason I keep saying there is no difference. He’s coming to sell everything,” Sowore tweeted.

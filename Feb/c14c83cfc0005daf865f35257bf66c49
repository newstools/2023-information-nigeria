As part of the efforts to fight illicit vote buying and inducements in Saturday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has deployed its operatives across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The Commission, in a statement on Wednesday by its spokesperson on Wednesday, Wilson Uwujaren, said it also released incidents reporting hotlines for the 36 states of the federation and the FCT.

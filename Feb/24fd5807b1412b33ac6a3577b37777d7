The Police Service Commission (PSC) has removed former All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign director in charge of civil society, Naja’atu Mohammed, as one of those who will supervise the conduct of police officers during the presidential elections. The Commission had on Sunday assigned the campaigner of Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, as one of the coordinators in the northwest. However, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) protested her inclusion. In a statement on Monday, spokesman of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, described Naja’atu’s appointment as callous and insensitive, urging PSC to withdraw her appointment immediately. He further stated that the appointment was openly confrontational and consequently unacceptable by the APC.

Ikechukwu Ani, spokesman of the PSC, confirmed the development to newsmen on Monday evening, stating that “the commission will always be sensitive to the wishes of Nigerians and will continue to contribute its quota to the sustenance of the nation’s democracy.” His words: “The Commission wishes to state with all sense of responsibility that its commissioners representing different geopolitical zones have always supervised assignments of the commission in the geopolitical zones they represent. It was the same with the present national assignment. “It wishes to restate its commitment to a free and fair 2023 elections where the Police as the lead Agency in internal security which includes election policing will discharge its duties according to the dictates of the law.”

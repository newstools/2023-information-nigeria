We are in the home stretch of the election and we think it is important now that INEC, the regulator, let us, all the parties and the nation, know how many people actually collected Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). “I think it is very important for the credibility of the results and the credibility of the elections. We have been acquainted with how many people were registered, but we don’t have the number of how many people who collected PVCs and that is very important to ask. “And I think I speak the minds of all the parties; how many people collected PVCs, the breakdown of the PVCs collection per state and per local government, and to every unit of electoral activity that INEC can provide that information. “We think it is a very important piece of information that will help INEC reinforce the credibility of the exercise that it is undertaking. Other than that, we are busy doing what we do best – preparing, planning,” he said.

Please, you just bought a house, which money paid for your house? Which money did you use in buying the house.” “And you’ll come and tell people that they are paying you. Oga, you no dey earn pass me. You no dey earn pass a lot of A-list artists that have been there for 20 years and working out their lives. You’re making them look like they’ve not been working. You’re making them look like what they’ve been doing, they’ve been playing.” She continued: “You can’t come and tell me that it’s film money you used in buying the house because at the end of the day, you don’t even earn more than me and the last time I checked, you have not even done up to ten movies.” “If there’s something else you are doing to make money, you can say it. But you can’t just come and say that film gave you this money. That’s a lie. It’s a huge lie,? the actress and singer added. Watch video below:   A post shared by Instablog9ja (@instablog9jamedia)

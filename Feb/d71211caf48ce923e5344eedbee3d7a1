 Nigerian comedian, Afamefuna Igwemba popularly known as Klint Da Drunk, has taken a swipe at commercial banks following the shortage of naira notes in circulation. Recall that Central Bank of Nigeria fixed Friday, February 10, as the deadline for the use of old naira notes. However, the Supreme Court in a ruling had said the deadline should be halted owing to the new notes scarcity that has left millions of Nigerians unable to access cash at banks and ATM points nationwide.

So in other words, you only withdraw paper. What kind of thing is that?” He continued. The comedian further urged the electorates to vote wisely in the forthcoming February 25 presidential election. “If you go to vote, do not vote for People Deceiving People. Some other people brought somebody that is doing us… and he knows how our condition be. And now they want to bring us another problem candidate. What we want is LP, Peter Obi and Datti,” he said.

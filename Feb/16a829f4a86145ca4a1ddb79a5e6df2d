The unit was alerted of the accident at about 8:45 pm and we arrived on the scene at 9:00pm. The accident was fatal, father, mother and their sons were rushed to the General Hospital in Badagry, where they were confirmed dead by the doctor on duty,” he said. The unit commander appealed to the Lagos State Government and well-meaning Nigerians to provide towing vehicles for the command in Badagry. “Trucks plying Agbara-Badagry expressway always develop a fault on the expressway and without a tow vehicle, we cannot move them from the road. It is difficult to get the vehicle in this axis but if we have a towing vehicle it will be easy for us to move them out of the roads,” he added.

Teachers in Osun state whose appointments were affected by the Executive Order issued by Governor Ademola Adeleke on Monday stormed the streets of Osogbo protesting against their sacking. The teachers who were protesting peacefully, pleaded with the Governor to revisit the Executive Order, with a view to reinstating them back into the state teaching service in order to reinstate their dignity as citizens of the state. Governor Adeleke had after his inauguration on November 27 last year, issued an Executive Order directing the review of workers employed in the state civil service after July 16 in the state and the committee reviewing the issue is yet to submit its reports since December last year.

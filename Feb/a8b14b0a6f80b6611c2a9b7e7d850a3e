We will distribute foodstuff to various communities,” the governor announced during a briefing at the State House in Marina. The governor said the move had become imperative to cushion the effects of the Federal Government policies. Aside from the fares reduction, Sanwo-Olu, who is seeking a second term of four years, also announced that food banks would be set up across the state. Through the food bank, he said, free meals would be distributed to vulnerable Lagosians.

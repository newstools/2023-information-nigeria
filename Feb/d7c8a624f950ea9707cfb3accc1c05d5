Iyorchia Ayu, national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has revealed that one of the five aggrieved governors of the party is dumping Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike’s Integrity Group before the 2023 general elections. The chairman claimed on Monday that Abia State governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, was in his house and they have resolved the crisis between them. Ayu disclosed this while wooing governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, a member of the G-5, to support the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. According to him, Ortom has nowhere else to go and hence, should return to the main factions of the PDP ahead of the forthcoming polls. Recall that the G-5, also known as the Integrity Group, includes Governor Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Seyi Makinde (Oyo), and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu). The aggrieved governors have been at loggerheads with the PDP national leader and have vowed to boycott the party’s presidential candidate until Ayu resigns his position.

Ortom has nowhere to go.” He said Ayu stressed that Ikpeazu visited his home after his preferred governorship aspirant lost his bid at a rerun primary election, which was held following the candidate’s death, whom Ikpeazu preferred as his successor.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has clarified that it does not have preference for any candidate or political party. The clarification is coming on the heels of the Commission’s liking of a tweet by Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), calling his counterpart in the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, an opportunist. Sowore had in a tweet called Obi an opportunist who fell in love with President Muhammadu Buhari, who he also described as wicked and incompetent, because of the Naira redesign policy. He also said Obi believed the policy would confer undue advantage on his campaign.

Ayo Adebanjo, leader of the pan Yoruba socio-cultural organization, Afenifere, on Saturday told the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu that northerners won’t vote for him in the 2023 election. The Afenifere leader who made the submission while addressing the crowd of supporters at the Labour Party (LP) rally in Ogun State held at the Ake Palace ground in Abeokuta, urged Tinubu to quit the 2023 presidential race and support the LP candidate, Peter Obi. Adebanjo maintained that the north will disappoint Tinubu in the 2023 election, and therefore advised the former Lagos State Governor to join the Obi/Datti movement before it is too late. He said, “All those that know Tinubu should tell him. I have always told and I will tell him again, the Northerners will not vote for him.

Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) Peter Obi has urged Kwara residents to shun ethnic, and religious sentiments as the general elections draw closer. Obi candidate made this known during the party’s presidential rally at the Metropolitan Square in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, on Monday. “This year’s election, they are going to come to you and they will tell you to vote for them based on tribe. Please, tell them you are hungry, unemployed, and suffering. No tribe buys bread cheaper,” he said. “They will come with religion and tell you that they are Muslims or Christians. Tell them you are hungry and have no jobs and the students are not in school. All these, you should resist. Do not allow them to continue.” READ MORE: ‘Peter Obi, An Opportunist Whose Party Lacks Structure’ – Seun Kuti Obi also promised to tackle insecurity in the country and ensure peace in every part.

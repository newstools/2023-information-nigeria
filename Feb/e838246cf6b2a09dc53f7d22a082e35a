Naja’atu Mohammed, a former All Progressives Congress (APC), Campaign Director on Civil Society Organizations, has insisted that the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, is part of the cabals dwelling in Aso Villa, in Abuja. Information Nigeria understands that her comment follows the statement made by the governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, that some Aso Rock cabals were working to frustrate the victory of the APC presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in the forthcoming elections. She maintained that, unlike El-Rufai, she was not afraid to mention names. Mohammed, who spoke during an interview on Arise Television’s morning show on Monday, claimed that Aisha’s cabal consists of her children and her brothers. Mohammed while stating that the First Lady sometimes instructs service chiefs, said, “The cabal that was led by the late Abba Kyari, may his soul rest in peace, and the reason why Aisha Buhari first started to attack the cabal then, it was because she was not part of the cabal then.

She physically throws them out. “If you remember the case of the shootings in the Villa, the gunshot in the Villa, who made that? “Aisha Buhari’s cabal is made up of her children and her brothers, she determined the appointment of the former NISER DG (Nigerian Institute Of Social And Economic Research, Director General). “She determined who is now her brother, same mother, same father at the Minting and Printing. “She sometimes, in fact, instructs Service Chiefs, So who is she? Is she not a cabal? And, of course, there are other cabals.”

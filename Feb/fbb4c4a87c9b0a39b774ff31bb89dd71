I really broke down after Big Brother. I have never shared this story. “I was really broken, because with pageantry, I did not get anywhere. I thought BBN would be different because it was out of my comfort zone. My people advised me to try it because I had been in Lagos for about a year hosting events. I recall that I used to tell Denrele Edun to give me some of the gigs that were below his pay grade.”

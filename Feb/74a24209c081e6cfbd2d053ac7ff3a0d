President Muhammadu Buhari has confirmed that the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele is working under his approval as opposed to allegations that the governor is riding solo by not properly briefing the president on the monetary policy. Recall the CBN in the last quarter of 2022 had redesigned the N200, N500, and N1000 Nigerian bank notes, giving the reason for its action as fighting against vote buying, terrorism and corruption in the country. Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have also accused Emefiele of acting and deceiving the president, to undermine the victory of the party in the 2023 general elections.

He said, “in the last quarter of 2022, I authorised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to redesign the N200, N500, and N1000 Nigerian banknotes. “For a smooth transition, I similarly approved that the redesigned banknotes should circulate concurrently with the old bank notes, till 31 January 2023, before the old notes, cease to be legal tender. “​In appreciation of the systemic and human difficulties encountered during implementation and in response to the appeal of all citizens, an extension of ten days was authorized till 10th February, 223 for the completion of the process. All these activities are being carried out within the ambit of the Constitution, the relevant law under the CBN Act 2007 and in line with global best practices.”

The Director of Strategic Communications for the Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Council, Chief Dele Momodu, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu with regards to perceived desperations of the APC candidate to win the polls at all cost. Reacting to recent reports on the elections, Mr Momodu said he has come across recklessly dangerous publication unilaterally awarding an impossible victory to the APC presidential candidate. According to him, the said newspaper is owned by Tinubu. “Only yesterday, we all saw how thugs of the APC Chieftains and his allies took over the streets of Lagos burning ballot boxes and documents and generally misbehaving in other to disenfranchise the determined electorates. “Despite all of these ugly attempts at stealing victory, the APC suffered its worst cataclysmic loss in most of the polling centers in Lagos. The same happened in Kano. Incapable of ever being sobered by the crushing humiliation in its traditional territories, we woke up this morning to read about the pathetic and illegal lies cooked up by the Tinubu media goons. “Tinubu remains the only mainstream candidate whose homebase of South West was decimated by opposition parties in Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, Osun and Ekiti. Most of the Northern Governors he also expected to help him garner votes in the Northern regions failed spectacularly to deliver the badly needed votes. “He failed in the South East and South South. “The only candidate with the national spread is the PDP Presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. But as a responsible citizen and respected statesman, he will never rush to the media to claim his well deserved victory and glory after a long and torturous journey,” Mr Momodu asserted.

It was quite a bizarre, unfortunate and unprecedented scene to watch,” he said. The PDP chieftain urged the president to find the courage to call the bluff of desperate politicians who feel they can buy the whole of Nigeria.

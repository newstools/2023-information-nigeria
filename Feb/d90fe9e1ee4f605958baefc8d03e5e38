The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says that some politicians in the country are plotting to manipulate the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) ahead of next month’s elections. Festus Okoye, the INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, stated this when he featured on Channels Television’s programme, Sunrise Daily, on Tuesday. His remarks follow the recent ruling by the Osun State governorship election petitions tribunal that nullified governor Ademola Adeleke’s victory in the July 16, 2022 election over excessive voting. He said: “Some of these fears are not valid. People are just throwing in issues into the fray to make sure that we disclose to them the complete and entire functionality of the BVAS.

We believe it is the ultimate arbiter in terms of those who want to manipulate the process. “I think that Nigerians should have faith in the BVAS. It is robust and will be a game-changer in the 2023 general elections,” Okoye added.

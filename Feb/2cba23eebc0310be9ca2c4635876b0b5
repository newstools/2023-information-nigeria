With less than 11 days to the forthcoming elections, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has advised politicians to be desperate about making the country work rather than resorting to physical or verbal violence. The former governor of Anambra State also told political opponents that the political violence being experienced in some parts of the country is unnecessary while speaking during an appearance on Channels Television ‘Politics Today’ on Monday. Obi, condemning the attack on his supporters in Lagos on Saturday, insisted that attacks be it verbal or physical should be discouraged in campaigns.

All I want is for Nigeria to start working again for everybody.”

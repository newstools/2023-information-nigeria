Daniel Bwala, spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential campaign council, has claimed that the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso would team up with his Party’s  candidate, Atiku Abubakar for the 2023 presidential election. According to Bwala, who spoke in an interview with The Punch, Kwankwaso has strong political influence in the north particularly in Kano and Jigawa States but that may not be enough for him to win. When asked about the probability of Kwankwaso taking a large chunk of expected northern votes from Atiku, he said that Kwankwaso’s presence on the ballot box would not stop Atiku’s expected victory, stressing that he expects an alliance between the two politicians before election day. If the alliance does not come through, Bwala maintained that Atiku would win because he has support spread across the nation.

But if he decides to run on that day (February 25) as a presidential candidate, I don’t think his position in the contest will be consequential in stopping Atiku from winning the election. This is because Atiku has overall support from the South-South, South-East and the North-East. “He has already secured 80 per cent control of three geopolitical zones. He is taking control of the North-West which is the largest voting bloc. “As a result, Kwankwaso gaining some votes in the North-West will not prevent Atiku from becoming president. But I am convinced that he will form an alliance with us before the day of the election.”

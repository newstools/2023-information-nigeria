Saidu called on politicians and residents of the State to discharge their rights and responsibilities without any form of violence or fear during the election period. “We urge all Nigerians to support our efforts to promote peace and stability during this critical period. “In light of the above the agency strongly calls on politicians to ensure that their supporters operate within the ambit of the law. “Politicians are also advised to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship and channel their grievances appropriately as provided for in the Nigeria Constitution,” she said. While advising the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure proper management and conduct of the election, Saidu called for deployment of security officials for the safety of voters and electoral officers throughout the election.

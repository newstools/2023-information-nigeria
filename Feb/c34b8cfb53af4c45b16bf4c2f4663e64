  Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have stormed the Ujiogba Forest Reserve in Esan West LGA, Edo, and destroyed 7,286kg of skunk and five hectares of its plantation. According to the National Agency for Food Drug Administration and Control’s head of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, the special operation carried out on Wednesday, February 22, followed credible intelligence that some cartels had warehoused hundreds of jumbo bags of the illicit substance inside the thick forest of the reserve for distribution to some states ahead of the general elections.

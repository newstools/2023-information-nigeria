The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested the Director General of the Peoples Democratic Party Campaign Council, Cletus Tyokyar. The PDP chieftain was said to have been arrested for being in possession of some money in the early hours of Saturday. Confirming the arrest, Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom said that the party DG campaign was arrested within the local government. He accused the anti-graft agency as an agent of destabilisation stating that what was found on him was a pantry sum of N100,000. “This is a shame, the EFCC officials this morning in Guma here arrested our DG campaign because they found just N100,000 on him.

Personally, I have more than that.” Ortom, who spoke to journalists after casting his vote at his polling unit R16 within the premises of Government Science and Technical College, Gbanjimba, headquarters of the Guma local government area, lamented that the whole council ward had to be transferred to polling units in the area as a result of insecurity in other areas of the state. No fewer than 17 polling units were within the premises of the college. The governor commended the Independent National Electoral Commission for the conduct of the election and the massive turnout in the state. When contacted, the spokesman for the EFCC in the state, Bayo Adeniran, said the case was under investigation. “The case is under investigation please,” he said in a text message.

Nollywood actor, Bishop Umoh, popularly known as Okon Lagos, has revealed that the fight to keep old naira notes from politicians is not for the benefit of Nigerians. He made this known via his Instagram page on Friday. The actor also noted that the naira redesign policy is not intended to punish the common man, but rather to maintain a free and fair election. He wrote, “No desperate vote-seeking Nigerian politician genuinely cares about you. Their fight to keep all old currency notes as legal tender isn’t for you! “Let it just be that N200, N100, N50, N20, N10 and N5 are made available. It will be enough to satisfy the cash needs of every common man. “What these vote buying politicians have are the exact old currency notes that are no longer legal tender (N1000 and N500).

   Bashir Ishaq Bashir, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Kano State, has reportedly defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) after meeting its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Pictures and comments circulating social media confirmed Bashir met with Tinubu in Abuja on Sunday evening, February 12, and discussed plans to formally join the APC. However it remains unclear if he would also abandon his gubernatorial ambition. The meeting, as seen via pictures, was also attended by the chairman of the Labour Party presidential campaign council in Kano, Mohammed Zarewa, and some other party leaders from Kano.

Recall that the LP governorship candidate alongside the chairman of the Presidential Campaign Council, Mohammed Zarewa; the state coordinator of Peter Obi’s campaign, Balarabe Wakili and a member of the presidential campaign council, Idris Dambazau had in January boycotted the party’s presidential rally held in Kano.

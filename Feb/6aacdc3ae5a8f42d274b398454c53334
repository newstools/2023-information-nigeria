 The Lagos State Police Command has declared one Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakare, wanted for threatening public peace and illegal possession of firearms. Bakare, popularly known as Oba Ogboni Abalaiye Ajamajebi was seen in a viral video on social media earlier in the week wielding a pump action rifle and threatening residents of the Surulere area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, in a statement made available on his verified Twitter handle, said “the CSP Egbeyemi-led Rapid Response Squad, working on actionable intelligence, carried out a sting operation on the residence of the man in the Surulere area of the state.

Any useful information leading to his arrest would be highly appreciated and treated with utmost confidentiality,” he added. While appreciating Lagosians for their vigilance and prompt information to security agencies, the Lagos State Police Command once again warns all troublemakers to steer clear of the state as anyone found wanting would be dealt with by the law.

A Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from suspending or expelling Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State from the party. The judge, James Omotosho gave the ruling following an ex-parte motion filed Wike against the PDP and its top officials in a suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/139/2023. Recall that Wike, in an application dated and filed on Feb. 2, had sued the PDP, its National Working Committee (NWC) and National Executive Committee (NEC). Others are the National Chairman of PDP, Iyorchia Ayu; National Secretary of PDP, Samuel Anyanwu and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as 1st to 6th respondents respectively. In the suit, the governor asked the court to direct all parties to maintain status quo and stay all actions in the matter relating to the threat to suspend or expel him by the 1st to 5th respondents pending the hearing and determination of the originating motion.

Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu has again taken a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari while expressing confidence in winning the 2023 election. Tinubu during his speech at the APC presidential campaign rally on Thursday in Osogbo, Osun State, boasted that he brought in the incumbent administration and would succeed it. According to the former Lagos State governor, the current administration wants to cause discomfort but he will not give up, regardless. He said, “Nobody smash the seed from a palm nut by being gentlemanly. We are not bastards. We were the ones that put them there and we will be the ones to succeed them.

We are grateful for the way you trooped out for us.” Information Nigeria recalls this is not the first time Tinubu would be calling out the APC-led federal government in recent times over some of its policies particularly as touching the 2023 elections. On Tuesday in Cross River State he lamented the exchange rate. Last week in Ogun State, he lamented the new naira policy and fuel scarcity.

 The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Muhammad Bello, has revoked the land allocation of the area where a two-story building collapsed in Abuja. This was disclosed in a joint press release signed by the Director of Press, Anthony Ogunleye, and the Spokesperson for Federal Housing Authority, Kenneth Chigelu, after a meeting between officials of both parties on Tuesday. Recall that an unfinished building collapsed last Thursday, due to infraction of building codes in Gwarimpa Estate, trapping 24 people, and killing three, while 21 persons were rescued. The minister, who regretted the loss of lives, commiserated with the families of the deceased and directed that a compensation plan be prepared for them.

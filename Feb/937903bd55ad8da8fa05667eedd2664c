Chimaroke Nnamani, the senator representing Enugu East Senatorial District, has sued the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu over the disciplinary actions taken against him for alleged anti-party activities. Nnamani filed the suit before the Federal High Court in Abuja on February 7, 2023, few days before his expulsion from the party. However, the former governor of Enugu State declared support for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, which had caused his initial suspension from the PDP. He said his support for the APC candidate was because he could not support a northerner to become President after the eight-year tenure of the current President, Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that February 10, 2023 the PDP expelled Nnamani alongside other key party members for anti-party activities.

Nnamani, in the suit asked the court to determine whether it was proper for the party to take disciplinary actions against him without giving him fair hearing. Despite being punished by his Party, the senator did not relent in his support for Tinubu of the rival APC. Nnamani hailed Tinubu for improving the health sector significantly in Lagos State, when he was governor between 1999 and 2007. “It is to Tinubu’s credit that HIV/AIDS prevalence in Lagos State decreased from 6.7 per cent to 3.5per cent between 1999 and 2007 while more than 2,000 women received prevention of mother to child transmission in 10 PMTCT centres set up to prevent the disease,” he said. He furthered that Tinubu’s performance in Lagos made him the best candidate to lead Nigeria at a time like this.

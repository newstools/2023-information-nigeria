 The Ogun State Police Command has arrested two suspects, who allegedly bought the stolen car of a couple, Kehinde and Bukola Fatinoye, who were killed on New Year’s Day in Abeokuta alongside their only son, Oreoluwa. The police, which paraded three suspects for the murder on Friday, said it arrested two suspects who bought the victim’s stolen vehicle on Monday. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, SP Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. Oyeyemi said the two suspects, Azeez Usman and Owolaja Aanuoluwapo, were arrested at different locations in the state following the confession of the arrested suspects.

He said, “After killing the couple, the suspects got hold of their son, OreOluwa and their adopted child, Felix Olorunyomi, tied them with rope and put them in the booth of the Hyundai car with which they drove them to Ogun river bridge at Adigbe area, and threw them into the river. “The suspects later parked the car somewhere in Oke-Ata area of Abeokuta, but later contacted Owolaja AanuOluwapo who went there and drove the vehicle to Azeez Usman’s workshop where the car was butchered into pieces and sold in parts. “Police investigation revealed that the two suspects were duly informed that the car was stolen, but they went ahead and bought it at the rate of N150,000.” Oyeyemi, however, said the Commissioner of Police, Frank Mba, has ordered that all the suspects be arraigned in court as soon as investigation is concluded.

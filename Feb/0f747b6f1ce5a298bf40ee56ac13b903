Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, has again revealed his choice presidential candidate as Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP), ahead of the 2023 general election. The Integrity Group (G-5) member on Thursday also mentioned that the All Progressives Congress (APC) alongside the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has failed Nigerians. While revealing he is working for Obi in the State, he noted that his support is based on the conviction that the former Anambra State governor is mentally and physically prepared for the task of getting the country working again. Ortom who was a guest at the Town Hall meeting which had stakeholders from the 276 Council Wards of the State, said the time has come for Nigerians to jettison political affiliation and loyalty and choose a God-fearing, capable and competent hand who would rescue the country from its sorry state. The PDP member said, “we have come to a time where we must leave out sentiments and save Nigeria by looking at individuals who can lead with the fear of God and provide gainful employment for the youths.

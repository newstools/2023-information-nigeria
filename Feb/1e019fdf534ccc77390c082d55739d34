The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will not accept the nomination of university lecturers who are card-carrying members of political parties, those who have political leanings or have been convicted of electoral malpractice as returning and state collation officers in the February 25 and March 11 elections. Mahmood Yakubu, the INEC chairman disclosed this in Abuja at a meeting with vice-chancellors of Nigerian universities. According to him, the collation of results for the elections would take place in 8,809 registration areas or wards, 774 local government areas, 36 states and the FCT that requires returning officers for each constituency. “Put together, we will engage 23,258 personnel as collation and returning officers. It is for this reason that this meeting is crucial. We need the support of our universities to source the requisite number of suitable academic staff of impeccable integrity who must also understand that this is a call to national service,” Yakubu explained.

Similarly, those who may not be involved in partisan politics but are known to have obvious political leanings should not be nominated. Furthermore, those who have been convicted of electoral malpractice must be excluded.” Yakubu further said the list would be carefully scrutinised and must be submitted confidentially in the manner the commission prescribes in his letter to the vice-chancellors. “Like all election duty personnel, each collation and returning officer will swear to an oath of neutrality,” he noted.

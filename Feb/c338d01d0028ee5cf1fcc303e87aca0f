 The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has expressed his regret for not signing a warrant for the arrest of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele. Gbajabiamila also said that the House would have no option but to reconvene before this month’s general elections if the CBN failed to address the hardships Nigerians face because of the currency swap policy. He said the House would continue to monitor the CBN’s implementation of the policy closely after the Green Chamber’s meeting with Emefiele on the issue.

The statement was titled “Currency Swap: We’ll Reconvene Before Elections If… – Gbajabiamila…says Tinubu stands with Nigerians.” “The House of Representatives intervened on several occasions. We summoned the CBN governor the first time and again, but he refused to answer because we had many hard questions for him. “It was until I issued the threat of warrant of arrest before he came, and I would have signed that warrant; it would have been the first time in the history of the National Assembly that a CBN governor would be arrested. I would have done it.” He added, “Many have argued on the independence of CBN, the autonomy of CBN. That doesn’t make CBN above the law. “So, we’re watching, and we’re monitoring very closely. If need be, we’ll reconvene the House, even though we have all been away for our elections. I’ll call the House back if need be.”

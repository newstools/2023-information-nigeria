 The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, on Tuesday, arrested an Abuja-based Twitter user, Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin, with the handle @SimisolaGold and Twitter name Simisola of Lala, for offering new naira notes for sale on social media. This was contained in a statement signed by ICPC’s spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua in Abuja on Wednesday night. The statement said the arrest was as a result of intelligence received which led the ICPC operatives to seek out and promptly arrest the suspect.

The anti-graft agency noted that the action is in furtherance of the collaboration between the Central Bank of Nigeria, the ICPC, and its sister anti-graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, in implementing the new cashless policy and naira redesign.

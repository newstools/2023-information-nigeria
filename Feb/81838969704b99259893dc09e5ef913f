Rufa’i Alkali, the chairperson of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), has said the party is not in talks with the standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. The chairperson also advised Atiku to give up his presidential bid for their party’s candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso. Alkali stated this in reaction to Atiku’s claim of being in talks with Kwankwaso and Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi. At a media conference in Abuja on Wednesday, Alkali clarified that the claim that Atiku is in talks with NNPP was so he could emerge as “the consensus northern candidate is false.” READ ALSO: Atiku In Talks With Obi, Kwankwaso Ahead Of Polls, Says ‘Sees No Threat In Them’ “We have no engagement with Atiku Abubakar on any level. “What will someone want to offer in northern Nigeria, if not Kwankwaso — since they’re talking about northern Nigeria now? “The NNPP fully dissociates itself from Atiku’s antics. We want Atiku Abubakar to step down for Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso,” Alkali said.

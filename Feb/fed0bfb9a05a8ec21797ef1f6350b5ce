A chieftain of the Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Femi Okurounmu has with reasons warned Nigerians against voting for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Okurounmu on Monday, during an online interactive current affairs programme, “Boiling Point Are­na” transmitted live on Oodua 99.9FM, said that Tinubu’s presidency will affect the future of the South West people of Nigeria. The Afenifere chieftain stated that the ‘slave’ treatment faced by the Yoruba people under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration might continue if Tinubu becomes president. The elder statesman further advised Nigerians not to be moved by the money-induced propaganda machinery of Tinubu’s foot soldiers, adding that misrule will continue if he wins.

Voting for him will plunge Yoruba into second slavery. He is even making fran­tic efforts to divide Afenifere. “When the armed herdsmen were killing our people in their farmlands and their villag­es, Tinubu did not say a word. When ENDSARS protesters were at Lekki and they brought soldiers who mercilessly killed our youths, Tinubu did not say a word. “When Yorubas were com­plaining about insecurity and killings and Igboho came up in defence of his people, Tinubu kept silent. “Tinubu is the reason why there is no Amotekun in Lagos presently like other Yoruba states. “Tinubu is the reason why Nigeria is in this current mess. He foisted Buhari on the nation. The Buhari that Tinubu supported was the same Buhari that took over power from the democrati­cally elected government in 1984 and harangued virtually all Yoruba politicians, includ­ing Chief Obafemi Awolowo in prison.”

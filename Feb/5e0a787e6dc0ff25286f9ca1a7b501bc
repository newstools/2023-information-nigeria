The president has received condemnation from several quarters over the policy including some governors of his party, the All Progressive Congress (APC). However, the PDP chieftain in the statement asserted that the people criticising the policy most are known for vote buying. Pearse remarked that the suffering was just for a short while and that just like what the president said the discomfort would soon end. He stated that “But it is a price the people must pay for an improved economy, more credible elections and a more secure society. “This is a case of short-term pain for long-term gain. I noticed that the loudest protest is coming from politicians, who are well-known for vote-buying. As the president has indicated, there is an end in sight for this discomfort. This is less than two months away, which is immediately after the 2023 general elections.”

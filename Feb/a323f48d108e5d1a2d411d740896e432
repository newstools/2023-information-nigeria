Manchester United on Thursday, played a 2-2 draw at Barcelona in the Europa League knockout round play-off first leg. Marcos Alonso headed the hosts ahead before Marcus Rashford’s powerful equaliser; Jules Kounde scored an own goal but Raphinha levelled with a fluke strike. Having previously met in two Champions League finals, both of which Barca won, the sides are on the path to recovery in trying to reach those heady heights again. This encounter in Europe’s secondary competition was another step on that road back to the top. Xavi’s men grabbed the opener when Marcos Alonso headed in at the back post from Raphinha’s corner, but United responded immediately through the in-form Marcus Rashford as he slipped in a finish at the near post.

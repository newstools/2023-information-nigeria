 Popular Nigerian Singer, Peter Okoye of Psquare has slammed Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti for saying Labour party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi is an opportunist. Recall that Seun Kuti had earlier stated that it takes the effort of dedicated Nigerians to save Nigeria, not an opportunist like Peter Obi. In a recent interview on TheMicOnPodcast, Seun Kuti argued that despite his relationship with one of the Presidential candidates, Omoyele Sowore, he believes that no politician can save Nigeria except for Nigerians themselves. The legendary singer’s son insisted that even if Sowore wins the election, he can not function efficiently in a country with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC) controlled states.

Seun Kuti insisted that Obi is simply an internet president whose election starts and ends on social media but not in a reality where he lacked structural background. Reacting to this Peter Okoye wrote: “Dude just erased his father’s history. You said only the people of Nigeria can save Nigeria. Is PO and the rest candidates not Nigerian people? Shame! Shame! Shame!!!” Not just Peter Okoye, as expected, other ‘Obidients’ slammed Seun Kuti saying: @destroyer_myth wrote: “He’s badly misinformed. Obi has been travelling around every part of Nigeria and local government by local government. That’s why he’s popular in the East, West, North and South. Obi has been travelling around the world undertaking studies and compiling ways to fix Nigeria.” @Chiweezy45: ” You are contradicting yourself bro. The only right person we have for now is Peter obi so we will vote him in.” @Gengpro1: “you go just smoke igbo and start to cap anyhow online.”

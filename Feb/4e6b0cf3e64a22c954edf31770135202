 Nollywood actresses, Iyabo Ojo, Sotayo Gaga and some celebrities have reacted to a trending video of ‘party money’ being printed and sprayed at an owambe (party event). The party hosts had gone the extra mile with the current Naira scarcity in the country to satisfy their guests. To also avoid arrest or the stress of getting the scarce Naira note, the host had printed her own notes for guests to spray at the party. Guests at the event, who wanted to spray money reportedly transferred the amount they planned to spray on the celebrant and in turn received the equivalent in form of the ‘party money’ which had the face of the celebrant printed on it.

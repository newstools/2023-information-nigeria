The Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has revealed the reason for the absence of former Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, at the Party’s presidential campaign rally at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt, on Wednesday. Amaechi, who is the APC leader in the State, was not in attendance at the rally to canvass votes for the Party’s presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, however some of his loyalists, including the APC Chairman in the State, Emeka Beke, were in attendance. The former transport minister had been largely silent since losing to Tinubu in the race to become the APC presidential candidate last year.

However, in a statement released shortly after the rally, APC spokesman in the State, Darlington Nwauju, said Amaechi was avoidably absent because he was attending to his academics, adding that the former minister is firmly in charge of the party in the State. He said: “If you are not aware, the former Transportation Minister is a Law school student and is attending to his academics. But you must also know that Amaechi is firmly in charge of the APC structure in Rivers State.”

Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has approved the use of the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Elekahia, Port Harcourt, for the presidential campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Tony Okocha, the State coordinator of the APC campaign council, revealed this at a news briefing in Port Harcourt on Wednesday, adding that the rally, which is slated for February 15, 2023, is to canvass votes for the Party’s flagbearer, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The APC chieftain said Wike, out of his benevolence, approved the use of the stadium without collecting the required N5m fee prescribed by Executive Order 21 from the campaign council.

He disclosed that an 11-man committee had been set up to coordinate and ensure the successful hosting of the rally, adding that the campaign committee in the state had done its homework to ensure that Tinubu wins in the State.

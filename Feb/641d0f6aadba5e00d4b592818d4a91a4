 A pastor has died in Mozambique after allegedly attempting a 40-day fast as depicted in the Bible. According to the Bible, Jesus fasted for 40 days and 40 nights after which he was tempted by the devil. BBC reports that the pastor, identified as Francisco Barajah, was confirmed dead on Wednesday. Barajah is the founder of one Santa Trindade Evangelical Church in the central province of Manica. The pastor was admitted to a medical facility in Beira, Sofala Province after he was found in a “critical condition”.

It was also reported that Barajah had lost so much weight that he couldn’t walk. Barajah, it is understood, passed away after the effort to save his life proved abortive. This is not the first time a religious fast would be claiming a life within the Christian community. In 2018, one Kehinde Omosebi and his wife were arrested in the United States after their 15-year-old son died from fasting. The teenager was found dead in the family house while another child, aged 11, was hospitalised.

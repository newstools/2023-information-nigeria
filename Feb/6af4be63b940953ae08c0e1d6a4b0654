Human rights activist and lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, said that the Naira redesign policy would affect politicians and vote buyers more than ordinary citizens. The legal practitioner stated this on Wednesday during an interview on Channels Television while speaking on a topic tagged ‘Naira Notes Swap Controversy.’ According to Ozekhome, due to the hit on the politicians because of the new naira policy, some political elites now use ordinary citizens as surrogates to stage protests and make the current situation look worse. He said, “The people that this policy will most hit, and that is why those who have been crying more have been the politicians.

And he surprised me, and it was a matter of fact. He said many of these politicians we are talking about actually own the banks,” Ozekhome narrated during the interview. “So if a bank is to dispense money, it will first give money to its Oga, the boss before thinking of others,” the SAN added. Ozekhome alleged that Nigeria is already a captured state by non-state actors, adding that, some elites and rich individuals are now richer than the country as a whole. He further lamented Nigeria’s current debt profile, saying the country is borrowing into her future.

Bayo Onanuga, the spokesman for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has branded the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), as well as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, as Nigeria’s “public enemies”. The spokesman, who was reacting to a preliminary objection filed by the the AGF asking the Supreme Court of Nigeria to dismiss a suit filed by three APC governors to stop the implementation of the CBN’s naira redesign policy, said by following in the footsteps of Emefiele, Malami has joined those who were bent on increasing the pains Nigerians were going through. In the preliminary objection, Malami had contended that the plaintiffs did not show reasonable cause of action against the defendant. However, Onanuga in a post via his official Twitter account, @aonanuga1956, on Wednesday, condemned the objection filed by Malami, tagging him along with the CBN Governor as an enemy of Nigeria.

Leloonu Nwibubasa, spokesman for the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, has said the governor Nyesom Wike-led Integrity Group, popularly known as the G-5 does not exist. The former Commissioner for Employment Generation and Economic Empowerment in Rivers State aired his views on the political developments in the State and the treatment meted out to the council by the State Governor, Nyesom Wike in an interview with Punch. While responding to the belief that the lack of support by the G-5 PDP governors could frustrate Atiku’s chances of winning the election, Nwibubasa maintained that the Wike only wants to people to believe he has the Integrity Group’s support.

The G-5 as mentioned frequently by Governor Wike is a mind game. He wants to keep people around him believing that he has support from the so-called G-5 or Integrity Group. “You are aware that Jonah Jang (former Governor of Plateau State) was one of the leaders of the group. Today, Jonah Jang works with Atiku Abubakar. He has made it very open that Plateau will vote five over five. As of today, his other colleague governors are campaigning in their states and they are saying people should vote for Atiku Abubakar. “In Abia or Enugu state, have you heard them campaigning for any other candidate apart from Atiku Abubakar? Go and find out. You will not even hear it in Benue State where Governor Samuel Ortom said ‘my preference would have been for the people to vote for Peter Obi if I were not a member of the PDP’.” “When Wike keeps saying “I have the G-5,” it is a mind game. I want to say clearly to the people that there is no G-5. What we have is a one G,” he said.

The governor who revealed this on Saturday, at the Rivers East Senatorial District rally of the PDP, held at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium, Port Harcourt, declared that he had never sponsored assassins against anybody and Rivers State politicians are aware of those who have killed many people in the state. Wike also denied the allegation of burning the venue approved by his administration for the PDP PCC to hold its presidential campaign rally.

He said: “Let me use the opportunity to debunk an allegation that some persons may have made that one Abiye Sekibo said that I sponsored assassination; attempted assassination on his life.

We know who has killed so many people in this state. “So, we granted approval for the candidate (president) of the party to hold their rally at Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium. I do know that if you go there today, no stadium has been burnt. “And so it is impossible for anybody to say somebody’s life was attempted and then the place was burnt down. It is not correct.” “And if there is anything like that, the person should report the matter to the police and all those found culpable will face the wrath of the law. “This is not the first time. If you know you don’t have the capacity to mobilise the support that you have promised, some people say so. Do not carry propaganda against innocent people.”

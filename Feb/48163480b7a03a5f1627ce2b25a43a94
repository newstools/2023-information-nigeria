Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, Ali Ndume, has disclosed that the redesign of the naira notes and the rushed implementation of the cashless policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is having a negative impact on the operations of Nigerian troops battling with insurgents at the frontline. Raising the alarm during an interaction with journalists in Maiduguri, Borno State on Saturday, Ndume picked holes in the claim by the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, that the policies were meant to plug the sources of terror financing and other security breaches, citing a recent viral video where some terrorists displayed the newly designed notes. “Naira redesign and the CBN’s cashless policy are actually gravely affecting the strategic operations of troops at all front lines of insecurity across the country,” Ndume said.

This situation has dampened the morale of the troops at the front line,” Ndume lamented.

Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has promised to revive the Ajaokuta steel plant if he is elected in the coming elections. The former Lagos governor speaking on Wednesday at the party’s presidential campaign rally in Lokoja, Kogi State, also promised to dredge the Niger River if he succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari on May 29. Tinubu maintained that North-Central has the potential for great mineral industrialisation, adding that agriculture will be the source of the nation’s prosperity. The APC flagbearer boasted that he is the frontrunner candidate and best candidate to lead the country in continuance of Buhari’s legacy.

You will see prosperity, you will see progress. “This is your determination; I want you to multiply it. On the 25th of February, there will be a vote for the president, senators, and house of representatives members. It is in your hands now. “But we have come to remind you, whether by Keke Napep or by bicycle or even with your legs, you should go there in the morning. Cast your vote and be vigilant. Do your part; play your own role. “I guarantee you I know how to do it. I am smarter than their candidate. I am the frontrunner, the best candidate. I know the road. I am a man who knows how to develop wealth, a man who keeps promises.”

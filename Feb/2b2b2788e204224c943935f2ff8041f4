The South-West Chapter of the All Progressives Congress has appealed to residents in the region, to reject any form of voter apathy in the forthcoming general elections. According to a statement made by the Zonal Publicity Secretary, Ayo Afolabi, on Sunday, those planning the apathy are exploiting the hardship brought about by the naira scarcity to achieve their hidden agenda, which is to incite Nigerians against the party and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Afolabi said, “Among all the presidential candidates, only Tinubu is pleading on the side of the masses, while the rest, especially the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar, do not care what becomes of the masses that bear the brunt of this policy.

We assure them of Tinubu’s commitment to ensuring they bounce back and better. “We, therefore, call on residents to see beyond this shenanigan and refuse to give in to apathy. We call on them to troop out and vote for the APC on February 25 to herald in the era of ‘renewed hope,’ which Tinubu has promised and which he is capable of delivering.”

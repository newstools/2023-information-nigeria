 Nigerian singer, Peter Okoye has said he would rather vote for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo against an Igbo man like the Chief Whip of the Senate and senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress for Abia North, Orji Uzor Kalu. The 41-year-old made this known on Tuesday via his social media handle after revealing that he is not supporting the presidential candidate of the Labour Party because he is Igbo. “If you think I am supporting PETER OBI because he is Igbo, try replacing him with Yemi Osibanjo against Orji Uzo Kalu and see if myself and Igbos won’t massively vote for Yemi Osibanjo,” the singer wrote.

He further lamented the hardship brought upon the people by the Naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), saying the policy will prevent APC from buying votes in the general elections. “Dear APC Governors, We the Nigerian people are not complaining about the policy. As a matter of fact we are so used to the hardship APC has brought upon us. We actually stand with Buhari and Emefiele on this one. We still have N50, N100 and N200 Note in circulations! Desperados,” Peter wrote in another tweet on Saturday. The singing twin brothers have openly pledged their support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi whom they are confident will win Nigeria’s presidential election on February 25.

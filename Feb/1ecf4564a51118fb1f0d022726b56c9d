Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Aviation Minister, on Friday, says the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, was sent by the devil to torment Nigerians. The CBN governor has come under heavy criticism over the scarcity of the Naira following the redesign of N200, N500, N1000 notes. The Supreme Court had also ordered that the Federal Government should not stop the use of the old notes from February 10. The APC chieftain, speaking on the economic hardship plaguing the nation took his Twitter handle to blast Emefiele.

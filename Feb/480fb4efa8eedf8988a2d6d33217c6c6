The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Friday debunked claims that it ordered commercial banks to accept the old N500 and N1,000 banknotes. Osita Nwanisobi, the spokesperson of the apex bank, in a statement described the claims as “fake and unauthorized”. Reports on Friday claimed that the CBN had ordered banks to start collecting the old N500 and N1,000 notes from the public. The reports claimed that the apex bank pegged the maximum amount the banks could collect from their customers at N500,000. But in a swift reaction, the CBN urged Nigerians to disregard the claims as it never authorised the banks to take such decisions.

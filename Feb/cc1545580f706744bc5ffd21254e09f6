 Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, has been criticized by Minister of Communication and Culture Lai Mohammed over his method of conducting his campaign rally ahead of the election on February 25. Throughout his campaigning across more than twenty states so far, Tinubu has avoided outlining his goals to win over people instead engages in throwing shades at opposition parties as well as dancing.

According to him, Tinubu is meant to use Buhari’s scorecard to campaign however, the difference is the case. He added that if Tinubu cannot say what APC has done in the past eight years, it would be difficult for anyone to vote for him. He said, “Tinubu is the major beneficiary of the achievements of the Buhari administration. “They are inseparable (Buhari’s scorecard and Tinubu’s presidential bid). It is one thing if Asiwaju Bola Tinubu was contesting on an independent platform, which is not available,” he said. “It is a different thing if he is coming in from another party, say Labour, then he can base his campaign on what he is going to do. But if your party has spent eight years in power and you cannot tell me what they have done, why should I vote for you?” Watch video below: – @Scordk: Scorecard of President Buhari and Project Tinubu are inseparable.

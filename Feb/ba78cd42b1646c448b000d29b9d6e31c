Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has said he no longer believes in the leadership quality of the people around Nigeria’s President, Muhammadu Buhari. The governor, who recently has been outspoken regarding the naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), caught the headlines when he said some “elements in Villa” were working against  Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). However, in a snippet of an interview with Premium Times, as shared on Twitter on Sunday, the governor said, “I believe in Buhari, I still do and I will never stop, but I no longer believe in the circle around him and the quality of decisions and actions coming out of that leadership.” READ ALSO: I’m Beyond Needing A Godfather, Not Looking For Appointment, Just Want Tinubu To Win – El-Rufai Recall that, in an appearance on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme earlier in the month, El-Rufai had said persons who backed a different aspirant in the APC presidential primaries are now hiding behind President Buhari to pursue their interests. “I believe there are elements in the villa who want us to lose the election because they didn’t get their way; they had their candidate. Their candidate did not win the primaries.” “They are trying to get us to lose the election, and they are hiding behind the president’s desire to do what he thinks is right,” he had said. https://twitter.com/PremiumTimesng/status/1624822705278033922?t=nuFB7dr2dgNmtWnAdYqFig&s=19

The media office of Labour Party’s (LP) presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has dismissed a viral “petition” alleging that he gave two billion to churches across the country. This comes after a petition making the rounds on social media platforms by one Frank Onwumere who claimed to be a senior pastor at the “Dominion Centre International” in Okigwe, Imo state, queried the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on how the said fund was disbursed among churches. The fund was said to have been gifted “to help and assist in mobilising and convincing their congregation to vote massively for the candidacy of Mr Peter Obi.” However, reacting on Sunday, the campaign team of the Labour party said the petition was “concocted to tarnish the hard-earned reputation” of the party’s presidential candidate.

Speaking on her next line of action, Empress averred that she has reported him to the appropriate authorities who are all on the look out for him. Her post read, “I’m so happy to have gotten my personal Instagram page back from the blackmailer, even though he did a lot of damage already. “This blackmailer ran away with my car, international passport, three phones, and valuables worth millions. Taking all my money but not my life like he has done to so many of his victims. Using my DM to chat ladies asking for dollar accounts and their nudes and blackmailing them. “I was glad I came out to speak. Putting his pictures out there brought out so many of his victims, it exposed a lot about him. The appropriate authorities are on it but he is still on the run. “I was able to escape and run for my life from his regular beating, threats, humiliation (I practically lived in the hospital) because I exposed him. Thank God I’m alive, free and getting my life back.” She wrote.

A fine Lionel Messi strike earned Paris St-Germain a comeback win over Toulouse to moved them eight points clear in Ligue1. Mid-table Toulouse took a surprise lead in Paris, with Branco van den Boomen scoring a free-kick after 20 minutes. Achraf Hakimi drew PSG level before half-time, and after the break Messi curled home expertly from 25 yards. The win moves PSG on to 54 points from 22 games, eight ahead of second-placed Marseille. PSG were missing Kylian Mbappe and Neymar because of injuries, and surprisingly fell behind to a set-piece by Dutch midfielder Van den Boomen. Hakimi made it 1-1 with a curling effort, before Messi took centre stage just before the hour mark with a left-footed bending first-time strike low into the corner of the net.

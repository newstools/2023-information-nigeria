A Spanish court has rejected a request by Brazilian footballer Dani Alves to be released from jail on remand as the investigation over an alleged sexual assault in a Barcelona night club continues, the regional court said on Tuesday. The 39-year-old, who has denied any wrongdoing, was jailed on remand without bail on January 20 after a local woman filed a complaint last month about an event at the exclusive Sutton nightclub in the city centre. Police are investigating and the case remains open over a crime of sexual assault. However, the court rejected the arguments and ordered him to remain on remand at the Brians 2 prison on the outskirts of Barcelona.

The case has attracted significant attention in Spain, because of Alves’ profile but primarily because sexual assault has remained a dominant political theme since the 2016 gang-rape of a teenager during the San Fermin bull-running festival which led to the toughening of sexual violence laws in the country. In Spain, a claim of rape is investigated under the general accusation of sexual assault and convictions can lead to jail time of between four and 15 years. Conviction of such a charge also paves the way for financial compensation to be paid to the victim to cover physical, physiological and moral harm

Paul Ibe, media adviser to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has said that Femi Fani-Kayode, spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) needs to be questioned by security agencies to explain the alleged coup plot levelled against Atiku to truncate the forthcoming elections. Recall that the Director of Special Projects and New Media of the APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) made insinuations in a tweet about an alleged coup plan by Atiku and top military generals that there is a possible plan to scuttle the forthcoming general election or perpetrate a coup d’état, an offence that attracts the death penalty. Atiku’s media adviser, in an exclusive interview with INFORMATION NIGERIA on Monday, maintained that the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Police have invited people over lesser things and as such, inviting Fani-Kayode should not be a problem.

People have been invited by security agencies for lesser things. And by inference, it is a very serious allegation. “There is no reason why Fani-Kayode should not have been invited to explain what he knows. If I am labelling people as anti-democrats and enemies of a State, that should fall as the highest crime against the State. “Fani-Kayode needs to be invited to explain what he knows, to give security agencies a lead on the weighty allegation and to explain what the so called meeting was all about. And if indeed there was a plot to subvert our democratic destiny, we need to ensure it is dealt with expeditiously.”

Charles Adias, the collation officer for the presidential election in Rivers State, has accused some members of the Labour Party (LP) of threatening his life. The collation officer, who is the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University Otuoke in Bayelsa State, made the allegation on Monday in Port Harcourt while addressing Deinye Pepple, the LP agent. While making observations, Pepple had faulted some results from particular polling units but commended the collation officer of the Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area (LGA) of the State. Responding, Adias said some LP members have accused him of rigging some areas, adding that he had received numerous phone calls from persons identified as the Party’s supporters. He told Pepple: “For the past two days, I have been receiving threats from members of your party.

We do not have any regard for what has happened before here.” According to him, his duty as the collation officer for the presidential election in the state is to receive results from LGAs and collate them as presented. He further warned parties to go to the polling unit if they have issues about results and votes, and not come to the collation center in a bid to transfer aggressions to other members of the society.

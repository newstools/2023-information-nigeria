The Presidential Campaign Organization of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged Nigerians to lay off the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, recompensing them with a humiliating defeat by voting enmasse for the candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar. According to Campaign Organisation, Atiku embodies the hope for a new lease of life in the country, hence the need to remove the APC for the untold hardship they caused in the almost eight years of their rule Spokesman of the Campaign, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Tuesday said, “Our campaign stresses that Nigerians cannot afford to gloss over the horrible experiences which they have been made to endure in almost eight years of APC, the administration which Tinubu claimed to have unilaterally foisted upon our country.

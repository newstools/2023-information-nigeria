The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Rivers State chapter, has directed all civil servants in the State to stay home owing to the current fuel and naira scarcity. Beatrice Itubo, the NLC chairperson in the State, stated this in a chat with journalists on Sunday night in Port Harcourt. Itubo, who is also the Labour Party governorship candidate in Rivers, lamented the poor welfare of workers in the state, adding that the country’s current economic crisis had reduced worker wages to nothing.

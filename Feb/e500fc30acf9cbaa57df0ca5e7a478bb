Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State says some “elements” in the Presidential Villa are against the presidential ambition of the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. El-Rufai said they are against Tinubu because their preferred presidential aspirant was defeated in the primaries of the APC, adding that they are working on seeing the ruling party also defeated in the February presidential election. While fielding questions on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme on Wednesday he said such individuals are hiding behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s desire to do what he thinks is right. He said, “I believe there are elements in the Villa that want us to lose the election because they didn’t get their way; they had their candidate. Their candidate did not win the primaries.

I will give two examples: this petroleum subsidy, which is costing the country trillions of Naira, was something that we all agreed would be removed. “In fact, I had a discussion with the president and showed him why it had to go. Because how can you have a capital budget of N200b for federal roads and then spend N2 Trillion on petroleum subsidy? This was a conversation I had with the president in 2021 when the subsidy thing started rising. He was convinced. We left. It changed. Everyone in the government agreed, and it changed. “The second example I will give is this currency redesign. You have to understand the president. People are blaming the Governor of the Central Bank for the currency redesign, but No. You have to go back and look at the first outing of Buhari as president. He did this; the Buhari, Idiagbon regime changed our currency and did it in secrecy with a view to catching those that are stashing away illicit funds. It is a very good intention. The president has his right. But doing it at this time within the allotted time does not make any political or economic sense.”

Mohammed Hassan, the Director General of Yobe State All Progressives Campaign Council (APC), has denied rumours that, Governor Mai Mala Buni of the State was stoned during a tour of Gashua, one of the biggest towns in the State. Responding to enquiries from journalists at the weekend, Hassan popularly called Dambu, said the story making the round that Buni was pelted with stone at the APC rally was the handiwork of the opposition. He said the alleged stoning of the governor by some irate youths was a figment of imagination of some mischievous opponents. “What is being concocted and peddled around was not true. Sincerely, speaking, I was among those standing on the surface of the podium when the whole drama started.

Unfortunately, immediately after he finished his turn, as Governor Mai Mala stood to take his turn many unwanted elements also took to the podium. Later, we realised that the podium could not withstand the load, so all of us decided to go down in a hurry. “To my knowledge, that was all that happened, but to everybody’s dismay, we learned about so many negative versions of the story. Consequently, we smiled that it was the handiwork of the opposition who are out to create mischief by providing false scenarios against our campaign team. “What they did didn’t come as a surprise simply they noticed the way and manner we are conducting our rallies, particularly in major towns of the state, that is why they the (opposition) introduced what they did in Gashua just to reduce our governor and the entire All Progressives Congress, campaign members,” he said.

 Iwuozor Edward Chinedu, a Nigerian-based in Athens, Greece, was nabbed by NDLEA agents at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport with cocaine and heroin concealed in his travelling bag that had a gross weight of 1.30kg and 900g, respectively. A statement released by NDLEA spokesperson, Femi Babafemi, says Chinedu was debarked from an Ethiopian airline flight on Friday 3rd February after officers in the tarmac team of NDLEA intercepted two bags during a secondary check exercise at the foot of the aircraft.

The pellets were used to construct false walls at the sides of the bag. “The two parcels contained substances that tested positive to cocaine and heroin with a gross weight of 1.30kgs and 900grams respectively. During preliminary interview, Chinedu claimed he came to Nigeria three months ago to do a surgery, which he was not comfortable doing in Athens. He further claimed he was given the bag to deliver in Greece for a fee of two million naira (N2,000,000),” Babafemi said.

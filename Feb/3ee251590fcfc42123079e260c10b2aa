A chieftain of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Buba Galadima, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, keeps sending prominent people to Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso, the NNPP presidential candidate, to quit the race and support him. Galadima stated this in an interview on Trust TV’s Daily Politics, adding that NNPP will win even in Atiku’s polling unit. He said, “We will defeat Atiku in Jada Local Government of Adamawa State. Atiku is not in this race. Yes on paper he is but he is not a candidate. How would he win, through what?

They know we know, they could not achieve their vision. “We are more northerners than them. Kwankwaso is from Kano and I am from Gashua. My village to the extreme part of the north is about 50 kilometers, so I am northerner than them and I am older. “Recently he (Atiku) sent some three prominent Islamic scholars to Kwankwaso’s house to kneel down for him pleaded to step down, we sent them away. Yes, who are they? We respect that regalia but if they remove it, we will ask small boys to deal with them.”

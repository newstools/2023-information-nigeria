Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Thursday dared the caucus he accused of working against the presidential aspiration of the party’s candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Aso Villa. El-Rufai had on Wednesday claimed that some elements in the presidency are working against the former Lagos State governor’s success in next month’s election. He added that the individuals in question are still bitter that their candidates lost out in the June 8, 2022, presidential primary that produced Tinubu as the APC candidate.

El-Rufai, who featured in a programme in the Hausa Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), insisted that he feared nobody in the country. “Respecting people is not fear, I swear we don’t fear anyone in this country, so we are not fearful, we are respectful but if you show us you are not an elder, I swear we will fight you.”

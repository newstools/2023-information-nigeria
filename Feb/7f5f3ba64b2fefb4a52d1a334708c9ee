The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Wednesday began the distribution of sensitive electoral materials to local government areas in preparation for Saturday’s election in Osun State. The materials which was monitored by representatives of political parties, journalists and observers, were moved from the premises of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to local government areas under heavy security. Some of the sensitive materials distributed were ballot papers and result sheets for the Presidential and National Assembly elections amongst others. Security operatives stationed at the entrance of the CBN had earlier prevented journalists and other observers from inspecting the materials citing a directive by the CBN that nobody is allowed into its premises.

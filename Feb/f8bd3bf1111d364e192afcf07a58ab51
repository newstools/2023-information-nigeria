Femi Fani-Kayode, former aviation minister, says any attempt to deny the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, his anticipated victory will lead to crisis in the country. The APC chieftain issued the warning while responding to the statement of the leader of the Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo. Information Nigeria understands that the Afenifere leader, while speaking at the celebration of the life and times of the late President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, George Obiozor, in Lagos on Wednesday, said there will be nothing like united Nigeria if Obi’s presidential bid fails this year. Adebanjo, who adopted Obi as his preferred presidential candidate in 2022, maintained that the former Anambra governor remains the best candidate.

However, Fani-Kayode, via a post on Twitter on Thursday, in reaction said the only thing that will provoke a crisis is Tinubu’s victory being annulled or denied his mandate. He wrote: “Prepare for crisis if Obi doesn’t win”- Baba Ayo Adebanjo. “Baba mi, the only thing that will provoke a crisis is if, after @officialABAT wins, someone attempts to annul or deny him his mandate. Such an act will result in not just a crisis but a monumental & raging conflagration.”

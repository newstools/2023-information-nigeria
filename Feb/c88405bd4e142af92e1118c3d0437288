 A late morning fire razed down about 200 houses on Monday, February 6, at the unofficial section of the Muna Internally Displaced Persons’ camp on the outskirts of the Maiduguri metropolis, Borno State. Eyewitnesses, who could not ascertain the cause of the fire, said it flared up, sweeping across the all-thatched houses around 11am. The population of the IDPs affected could not also be immediately ascertained, due to the fact that it is an unofficial camp.

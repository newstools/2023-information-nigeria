Former Minister of Sports, Mallam Bolaji Abdullahi and other PDP senatorial and House of Representatives candidates have rejected the outcome of Saturday national assembly elections held in the state. Abdullahi, the PDP senatorial candidate, lost to Mallam Saliu Mustapha, a former APC national chairmanship aspirant. According to the former minister, the preliminary review of the results “shows substantial irregularities and manipulations that are inconsistent with the provisions of the electoral law.” APC defeated their PDP counterparts in a clean sweep of all the 9 national assembly seats in the state after the announcement of results by INEC on Sunday.

Nollywood actress Beverly Naya has opened up about how she was bullied and called ugly while she was growing up. The actress shared this experience in a recent interview with popular media personality Chude. She mentioned that she was bullied at a young age and that she was always getting attacked verbally and physically by her friends because of her looks. Naya said, “My formative years, I was always getting bullied for one thing or the other and so no matter what school I was in, I always felt like there was always going to be something that I was going to get attacked for. “So, when I was younger, I was an ugly duckling. I wasn’t cute. I don’t care what my mom says. I was not a cute kid. “I had crooked teeth, eczema, I just didn’t look good as far as I was concerned, and as far as people around me were concerned. I used to get called ‘snakeskin, buck teeth, light bulb head, football legs’ just different kinds of stuff and then I just blossomed. ”My skin cleared, I got braces, I just kind of blossomed. And I started to kind of feel beautiful for the first time in my life around 16 and I think I probably was owning it a bit too much for some people in my school.

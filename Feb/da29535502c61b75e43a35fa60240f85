AC Milan ended a seven-game winless run as Olivier Giroud’s goal gave them a home Serie A 1-0 victory over Torino. Giroud scored a glancing header from Theo Hernandez’s cross from the left. Hernandez had a great opportunity to score a second for Milan but dragged a shot wide from Rafael Leao’s pass following a quick counter-attack. The visitors had the better chances of the first half but Antonio Sanabria fired off target and twice had efforts saved by goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu.

Cynthia, wife of Big Brother Naija host, Ebuka Uchendu, has responded to those insulting her husband. This is coming days after Ebuka, during the live eviction show, asked one of the housemates, Yemi Cregx’s about his secret flirting night activities with his co-housemate, Blue Aiva. Ebuka had asked Yemi why he keeps leaving Khosi’s bed at night to meet Blue Aiva every night and was assuring her that she will not be a side chick for long again. Yemi Cregx, however, denied everything Ebuka said he was doing. A fan of Yemi, who wasn’t pleased with Ebuka’s action, rained heavy curses on Ebuka and his generation via Twitter. She tweeted, “I now pray every day against Ebuka. Ebuka will never know peace until he undo what he has done against Yemi Cregx”.

She also wrote, “The audacity for you guys to constantly harass someone to do something, then when it’s done and they result to sending death threats, the ridiculousness of you lot to be so vile and toxic over a bloody entertainment show. “Even the people who you think should have sense spend their whole day here tweeting vile things about human beings. For f**k sake, watch, laugh and move on”.

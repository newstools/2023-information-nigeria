 Unknown gunmen on Saturday morning, attacked the country home of Nnaemeka Obiaraeri, the House of Assembly candidate of the Labour Party, in the Okigwe Local Government Area of Imo State. Obiaraeri’s house, cars and those belonging to his relatives were burnt and destroyed by the gunmen who stormed the place in three vehicles. The candidate who confirmed the attack in a statement on Saturday morning, blamed the attack on the “failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administrations in the state and at the centre.” The LP candidate said, “Just got another share of the terrible state of insecurity in Nigeria. “Gunmen, surely known to their sponsors, went to my country home in Amagu Ihube to burn down my house and burn to ashes my operational factory vehicles parked there.

I have not eaten anyone’s yam or fish. “This is another evidence of the failure of the APC Governments in Imo State and Aso Rock, Nigeria to live up to their OATH OF OFFICE of protecting the lives and properties of law-abiding Nigerians. Total failure of governments and leaders. “This again reinforces our call for Nigerians to pick their PVCs and help vote in Peter Obi and Datti Baba Ahmed of the Labour Party as the Next PRESIDENT and VICE PRESIDENT of Nigeria.”

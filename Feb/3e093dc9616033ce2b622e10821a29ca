Rt. Revd. Sam Bamgbose of the United African Methodist Church, says if the political elite had given vice president Yemi Osinbajo the opportunity to lead the country as president, Nigeria’s present socio-economic situation would not have surfaced. The Bishop made the observation on Friday at a funeral service held at the United African Methodist Church Catherdal, Ebute-Meta, Lagos. While peaking on “a life of legacy, impact and service to humanity”, Bamgbose stated that what counts after man’s sojourn on earth is the impact that the person made in his or her community and in the lives of others, while alive. In his words, “Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is one Nigerian that served his country selflessly. Whatever it is that you have encountered here on the course of your service to this nation, the Lord will see you through in Jesus’ name.” READ ALSO: Nigerians Will Hold Leaders Accountable At Ballot — Osinbajo Assuring Osinbajo of the Church’s continuous prayers and support, he said, “I am going to encourage you sir, it is not over until it is all over. Your time will come and we will all stand behind you. The grace of God will be behind you. “We are proud of you, sir. You have done so wonderfully well. You have represented the church well, represented your community (the Yoruba race) well, and you have represented entire Nigeria well, in the few times/occasions when you had the grace to be vested with power. We knew what happened to our country, if you had been allowed to continue, we know that we would not be in this mess that we are experiencing today.” Joined by other clergymen at the service, the cleric led a special prayer session for Osinbajo, God’s continuous guidance and protection, the entire nation and for the peaceful conduct of the 2023 election. Asides from the presence of the vice president, present also was Chairman of the Board of the Nigerian Christian Pilgrims Commission, (NCPC), Yemi Kasali.

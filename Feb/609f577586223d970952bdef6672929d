As Nigerians continues to decry the scarcity of new naira notes which has led to unrest, with protests from aggrieved Nigerians nationwide, barely few days to the general election, concerned nigerans have lamented over the reactions of some governors advocating for the extension of old naira notes as legal tender. Muiz Adeyemi Banire, a Senior Advocate [SAN] and human right activist has reacted to the concerns of governors of the All Progressive Congress for kicking against the stance of President Muhamadu Buhari and CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele on the new notes policy. Dr. Muiz in his reactions, highlighted the motives of APC governors behind their ordeals, saying the aggrieved governors are not doing it for the average Nigerians but for themselves. He said: “A lot of us might not understand why the Governors are insisting on the old notes being legal tender. Certainly it is not that they don’t know that they do not have the power to declare what is legal tender neither did they not know that do not lack the capacity to enforce any Supreme Court judgment.” READ MORE: Naira Scarcity: Tinubu Denies Telling Nigerians To Disregard Buhari‘s Order “The secret is simply that they are out to deceive the unwary potential voters into accepting the already stocked old notes in their custody for the purpose of buying voters’ conscience.” Muiz however, urged electorate to insist on new naira notes if politicians would buy their votes and vote for their conscience. “My counsel is that potential voters who must take money should either insist on the real legal tender as pronounced by the apex Bank or any other currency acceptable to them. However I admonish that your conscience is not worth buying but if you must collect the money which mostly is stolen from the treasury, insist on legal tender and still vote your conscience. This is part of our leadership campaign leadership series.”

 The All Progressives Congress (APC) has refuted claims that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the party’s presidential candidate, encouraged Nigerians to disregard President Buhari’s directive regarding the new naira notes. In a statement released on Friday, Mr. Bayo Onanuga, Director of Media and Publicity for the APC Presidential Campaign Council, claimed that the allegation was an effort by opposition groups to drive a wedge between Buhari and Tinubu. Onanuga described the report as fake news, stressing that Tinubu never issued an advisory on behalf of Asiwaju Tinubu.

According to him, it was inconceivable and unthinkable that Tinubu would instruct APC governors to disregard President Muhammadu Buhari’s order on the currency matter. Onanuga, therefore, urged journalists to always confirm the authorship of their materials from the Media and Publicity Directorate of the campaign.

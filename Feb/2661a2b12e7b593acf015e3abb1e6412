You don’t need to insist on White Collar jobs to survive; all you need is determination to achieve,’’ Abdullahi said. He said there was the need for massive campaigns by relevant stakeholders to sensitise the populace to the dangers of seeking for greener pasture abroad. “There is also need for serious surveillance at the borders. “The traffickers who take Nigerians to seek for greener pastures should be arrested and prosecuted according to the law to serve as deterrent to others,’’ Abdullahi said. The returnees were received in 2022 by NEMA, the National Commission for Refugees, Migration and IDPs, and the Nigerian Red Cross among other relevant government agencies.

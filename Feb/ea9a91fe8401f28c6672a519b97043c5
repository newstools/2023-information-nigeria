Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker, has said that there will be more attacks from the governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) directed at President Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that in the early hours of Thursday, the president announced that N1,000 and N500 notes were no longer legal tender in the country while N200 notes would phase out in April 10, 2023. However, following the directive, some APC governors have expressed displeasure with the development. Information Nigeria had reported Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, berated Buhari for refusing to abide by the Supreme Court order and going ahead with the ban on the old Naira Notes. Ganduje was quoted saying, “Imagine someone has been contesting without winning elections until after a merger was formed. He won the election and spent four years and re-contested again and he won, now that he is about to go, he is doing nothing but to destroy the party that elected him.” READ ALSO: Banks Hoarding New Naira To Aid Politicians’ Vote Buying Next Month – Shehu Sani Alleges Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai also slammed the President over the decision and asked residents of the State to continue using the old Naira notes. “The address by the President earlier this morning (Thursday morning) limiting the legal tender status of old notes to only N200 amounts to total disregard and disobedience of the ruling of February 8th, which the Supreme Court extended further yesterday (Wednesday).” Sani, nonetheless warned Buhari to expect more attacks since he made a decision not favorable for his party. He said, “The President should expect more attacks from his Party’s Governors. “He has taken the miracle stick and crossed and wants to leave his men in the middle of the Red Sea.”

May on her Instagram page on Friday revealed that she had directed her lawyers to file a suit against one Sarah Chukwukere, with the username @officialsarahmartins, for sharing an edited image of the entrepreneur and her children. The said image originally featured May and her four children. Chukwukere, however, posted a doctored version of the picture, which included Yul Edochie, his second wife, Judy Austin, and their first son together.

In the letter dated February 1, 2023, it was stated that Sarah implied during the live chat that May, “failed in her duties as a wife to Mr. Yul Edochie and that such failures led Mr. Yul Edochie to leave our Client (May) and get married to Ms. Judy Austin.” Contained in the list of demands are a public apology, full retraction of the statement and an assurance that such false utterances will not be made in the future. May also further threatened to sue for N500 million in damages, should Chukwukere refuse to accede to the stated demands.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Organisation has fired the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, over his reported attempt to disrupt the forthcoming general elections and form an interim government. Spokesperson for the PDP campaign organisation, Kola Ologbondiyan, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday in Abuja, said the date for the presidential election must not be scuttled or postponed. The PDP campaign advised the APC to immediately perish its narratives or demands for the postponement of the 2023 general elections, saying that it has reports of sinister plots by the ruling party to create situations to justify its demands. The campaign council also asked the APC presidential campaign council to perish the idea of setting up an Interim National Government as such does not have any place in Nigeria’s democratic practice and is not recognised by the Nigerian Constitution. It maintained that Tinubu has nothing to offer the nation, adding that he  should quit the race instead of seeking to destroy the country’s democracy because of “his wishful thinking that he will govern our nation.” The campaign said Nigerians are ready to come out enmasse to vote for the PDP flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar, as the next president and that the shenanigans of the APC campaign cannot sway Nigerians from that resolve. The statement reads: “The PDP Presidential Campaign team has received intelligence of a dangerous plot by the Tinubu/Shettima campaign to continue to orchestrate unrest across the country aimed at truncating the electoral process, triggering a constitutional crisis and foisting an undemocratic situation of Interim National Government on the country, having realised that it has no chance in the election.

It is what we are doing; It is being determined; you do it at all cost; fight for it, grab it, snatch it and run with it’. “Such inciting comments are at the root of the violent attacks on innocent Nigerians as well as facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by APC thugs in various parts of our country. “Part of this plot is the reported interception, mopping up and hoarding of new Naira notes by the Tinubu/Shettima campaign for vote buying leading to the biting scarcity of new Naira notes and consequential suffering and hardship across the country. “It is indeed pathetic that Tinubu, who ought to know that the 1999 Constitution, upon which our democracy derives its existence, is the one reported to be pushing for a situation of an Interim National Government (ING), just because it is clear to him that he cannot win the February 25, 2023 Presidential election.” It added: “Tinubu must come to the full realisation that his reliance on financial inducements alone cannot save him as there is no way Nigerians will elect any individual convicted for trafficking in narcotics, indicted in many criminal allegations and who has also shown manifest incapacities to serve as the President of our nation. “Our campaign, standing with Nigerians, calls on INEC to immune itself from the shenanigans of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign and focus on its mandate to deliver a free, fair and credible Presidential election on February 25, 2023. “We also call on security agencies to note the machinations of the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign and take urgent steps to protect the electoral process and our democracy from being derailed at this point.”

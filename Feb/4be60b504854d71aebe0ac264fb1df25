Barcelona maintained their eight-point lead at the top of La Liga with a 2-0 win over struggling Cadiz. Sergi Roberto gave Barca the lead late in the first half from a rebound after Robert Lewandowski had a header cleared off the line. Three minutes later Lewandowski drilled in a fine drive from the edge of the box after being picked out by Roberto. It was both players’ first league goal at the Nou Camp since 23 October’s 4-0 win over Athletic Bilbao.

The Poland striker has scored 15 goals in his first 19 La Liga appearances – with only Cristiano Ronaldo, in 17 games in 2009-10, reaching that total in fewer matches since the turn of the century. Barcelona, whose nearest title rivals Real Madrid beat Osasuna 2-0 on Saturday, have won their past seven La Liga games and are unbeaten in 13. Their remarkable defensive record continues too with a 17th clean sheet of the league season, a record after 22 La Liga games (passing Deportivo de La Coruna’s 16 in 1993-94). Cadiz, who had two Roger goals disallowed, remain two points above the relegation zone.

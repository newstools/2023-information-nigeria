Serie A leaders Napoli moved 18 points clear at the top of the table with a routine away 0-2 victory over Sassuolo. Napoli scored after only 12 minutes through Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, shooting low into the corner after a fine run. Armand Lauriente hit the post for the hosts, before Victor Osimhen hit the woodwork for Napoli. Osimhen made it 2-0 after 33 minutes when he powerfully shot on the turn and beat Sassuolo goalkeeper Andrea Consigli at his near post. Osimhen has now scored in seven successive Serie A matches for Napoli, who are trying to become Italian champions for only the third time and for the first time since 1989-90. The visitors thought they had added a third goal in injury time through Giovanni Simeone, but it was ruled out after a video assistant referee check showed there was an offside.

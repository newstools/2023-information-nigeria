A South African rap star is one of two men killed in a drive by shooting in the city of Durban. Rapper AKA, real named Kiernan Jarryd Forbes, was just 35 when his life was brutally cut short on Friday – and not long before he was due to take to a stage to perform. AKA and the second man were standing outside a restaurant in the South African city when they were killed by gun fire. Local reports have stated that the pair were shot at 10pm local time (8pm GMT) and that two cars drove past with passengers opening fire unleashing a hail of bullets.

Paramedic Garrith Jamieson told Times Live: “On arrival, paramedics met total chaos and a scene where two men, believed to be in their late 30s, sustained multiple gunshot wounds. “Paramedics assisted the men and unfortunately the first male had sustained multiple gun shot wounds and showed no signs of life and was declared deceased at the scene.” While further reports have suggested AKA was shot six times. Fans have taken to social media to express their shock and sorrow. One fan wrote on Twitter: “RIP AKA…the music industry in this world won’t forget you. You did great sir.”

The Labour Party (LP), Nasarawa State chapter, has appealed to party loyalists across the 13 local government areas of the state to remain law abiding citizens and remain calm over Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), delay in uploading election results. Mr Alex Emmanuel, LP State Chairman, while briefing journalists on Sunday in Lafia, the state capital, called on INEC to, as a matter of urgency, upload election results as earlier pleged before the 2023 election. He explained that INEC’s delay to upload election results has called for concern among Nigerians, particularly party supporters in Nasarawa, and in the country as a whole.

He, however, applauded INEC for bringing innovation in this year’s election, especially the use of Bimodal Voters Accreditation System, and appreciated security personnel for maintaining law and order. Mr. Emmanuel, LP State Chairman, also commended the people of Nasarawa State for coming out en masse to vote for the Labour Party to make Nigeria great again.

The Ogun Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Olaniyi Ijalaye has said that the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) was to be blamed for the late arrival of election materials in some parts of Ogun State. According to Ijalaye, the delay in the commencement of voting and the unavailability of election materials in some areas is the reason voting began late. The REC made the disclosure during his visit to a State governor Dapo Abiodun’s polling unit for an on-the-spot assessment of the ongoing voting exercise in the area and at other polling units in the Ikenne LGA.

He said, “With all due respect, it is not just the governor’s polling unit but with a few others that had one or two challenges. But as we speak, voting has commenced there and until the last man and woman have voted, we will not close voting. “I am really pleased that people have trooped out to exercise their civil responsibility by voting for candidates of their choice. Virtually everywhere I have gone, accreditation has taken place and voting has commenced in some places. In some other places, accreditation is ongoing, while in a few other areas, we are having challenges with the issue of transportation. “We are in collaboration with the NURTW and there is a bit of few logistical issues that have now been resolved. I want to give the good people of Ogun State the assurance that no one will be disenfranchised. Even if voting commences now, we will not close voting until the last person has voted.”

Marcus Rashford continued his post-World Cup scoring streak as a Manchester United side reduced to 10 men survived late Crystal Palace pressure to secure Premier League 2-1 victory at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot after the video assistant referee spotted a Will Hughes handball and United seemed to be cruising when Rashford turned home Luke Shaw’s cross 17 minutes into the second half for his 11th goal since returning from Qatar. But the contest turned dramatically when, amid a confrontation that resulted in both Antony and Jeffrey Schlupp being booked, VAR Tony Harrington spotted Casemiro with his hands round Hughes’ neck. After a pitchside review, referee Andre Marriner sent the influential Brazilian off for violent conduct, which triggers an immediate three-match domestic ban. Schlupp halved the deficit almost immediately and amid increasingly frantic scenes around the home area, United ended the game with four central defenders protecting their goal as Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof were added to starting pair Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane.

United’s 13th consecutive win at Old Trafford lifts them to third in the table while Palace remain 12th.

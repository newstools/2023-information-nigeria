The event, which was attended by hundreds of supporters of the party, doubled as the APC’s zonal campaign rally for the Yobe North district starte However, as soon as Buni stood to deliver his speech, the angry supporters, who had loudly cheered Lawan when he spoke, began to chant slogans of rejection; ‘bwamayi bwamayi bwamaso,” meaning “we don’t want you.” READ ALSO: Atiku Can’t Distract Me, Wasting His Time Calling For My Resignation – Lagos REC, Agbaje The embattled supporters subsequently started throwing objects at the governor and other guests at the poduim.

The Commissioner of Police in Nasarawa State, Maiyaki Baba, has decried the high numbers of thugs that politicians are importing into the state ahead of the February 25, and March 11, general elections. Maiyaki made this known yesterday in Lafia during the signing of a peace accord by candidates of various political parties. He said, “Intelligence before us revealed that some people are trying to bring thugs into Nasarawa State; which is not the tradition in the state. “I want to inform the candidates across the state that the information is before us and it is important to bring to your notice. We are up to the task to the extent that our security agencies have been directed to continue in carrying out patrol and raiding hotels where some of the hoodlums may be kept.” The CP, who is the state Chairman of Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security in the state, reiterated that men and personnel of the command, in conjunction with sister security agencies, were ready to deal with any act capable of breaching peace. However, candidates of 14 political parties, including the incumbent Governor, Abdullahi Sule, signed the accord to ensure peaceful conduct of the polls. The peace accord was organised by the Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security in collaboration with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

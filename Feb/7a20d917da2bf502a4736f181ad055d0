 The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Borno State Chapter, on Tuesday directed its members to immediately reopen all its outlets across the state. The association said this in a statement by its chairman, Mohammed Kuluwu. The state chapter of IPMAN had earlier ordered its members to suspend payments for petroleum products and other operations until further notice. The association said the decision followed the loss being recorded by its members who are being compelled by the government and its agencies to sell petroleum products at certain prices.

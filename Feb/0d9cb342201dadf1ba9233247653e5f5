He is not ready to take an additional wife, whether a Christian or a Muslim”, said the statement from Tinubu’s Media Office. According to the statement, “the intention behind those peddling a new Muslim wife is not only to cause discord within the extremely peaceful family of Asíwájú Tinubu but to also create disaffection within the Christian community. “Their intention has failed. It will not cut a dice anywhere”. The statement enjoined Nigerians to completely disregard the unfounded news. “Asíwájú Tinubu is at present focused on his campaign to emerge the president of this country come February 25, 2023, in order to rekindle the hope of our people in a better, stronger, more secure and prosperous Nigeria. “Senator Oluremi Tinubu is also busy traversing the length and breadth of the country canvassing support for her husband. They will not be distracted by this baseless news”, the statement added.

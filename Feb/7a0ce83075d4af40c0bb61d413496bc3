The government of Kaduna State has directed its ministries, departments and agencies to ensure revenue collection agents accept payments made in old and new notes. The directive was contained in a statement on Sunday, signed by Muyiwa Adekeye, special adviser to the governor on media and communication. According to the State government, the acceptance of the old notes was in line with the subsisting order of the Supreme Court. “In line with the subsisting order of the supreme court, the Kaduna state government has directed its ministries, departments and agencies to ensure that their collection agents continue to accept payments made in all denominations of the naira, old and new,” the statement read in part. “The laws of Kaduna state do not allow personnel of government agencies to be involved in cash collection of revenues.

He also noted all existing old N1000 and N500 have ceased to be legal tender, but stated that the denomination remain redeemable at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). His directive came less than 24 hours after the supreme court insisted that the old notes were still valid, and adjourned the case filed by several States, challenging the deadline of the old notes till February 22. Nasir El-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, in a counter directive following the president’s national broadcast, said all the old and new notes remain legal tender in the State pending the supreme court’s decision. Meanwhile, the CBN has commenced the collection of the old naira notes as ordered by Buhari.

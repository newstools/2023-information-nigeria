Paris Saint Germain stars led by Lionel Messi and Neymar offered an apology to fans on Tuesday after their 1-0 Champions League loss to Bayern Munich. It was a night to forget for the French giants, as they struggled to find a way into the game until Kylian Mbappe’s introduction after half time and went behind after a goalkeeping error from Gianluigi Donnarumma let Kingsley Coman’s shot in. They will now need to beat Bayern at the Allianz Arena next month if they are to advance in Europe. The PSG players acknowledged their poor showing after the game, as Neymar and Messi took the players to the club’s ultras to offer a meek apology and thank them for their support. There was an excellent atmosphere from the home fans despite the performance,  as the supporters sang for their side throughout the game despite a lack of energy from their players. Mbappe did threaten to bring PSG back into the tie and put the ball in the net twice, but both were ruled out for offside as Bayern held on to a vital away lead. The result marks a worrying trend for Christophe Galtier’s side, who have now lost five across all competitions this year.

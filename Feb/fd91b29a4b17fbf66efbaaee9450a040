Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has appealed to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to allow commercial banks accept deposits of the old N500 and N1000 notes to ease the sufferings faced by Nigerians. Recall that Atiku had earlier backed the currency redesign policy, advising the apex bank not to extend the February 10 deadline for the demonetisation of the old naira notes. The former vice-president also said any further extension would destroy the purpose and objective of the policy. “I am totally in support of building a cashless economy and reducing the amount of cash in our economy,” Atiku had said. However, in a Facebook post on Sunday, he called on the CBN to release the new notes as “a matter of urgency”.

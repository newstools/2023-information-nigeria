The gubernatorial candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance in Enugu, Chief Frank Nweke Jr. has described Peter Obi of Labour Party as the best among all the three leading presidential candidates for the 25 February election. Nweke whose party, APGA also has a presidential candidate, Peter Umeadi, said Obi is the best because he has character, capacity and integrity. He therefore urged the people of Enugu to vote for Obi in the Feb. 25 presidential election, but to cast other votes for APGA candidates. The APGA candidate who made this known while addressing the 48th Annual Synod of the Methodist Church of Nigeria in Enugu on Friday added that the church had a major role to play in the enthronement of good leadership. He therefore pledged to partner with the church in improving education and reinventing the society if elected in March 11. He promised to hand schools back to missions because schools were better managed by churches, especially primary schools, the foundation of education.

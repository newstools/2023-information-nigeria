 The All Progressives Congress in Taraba State has said that its governorship campaign will continue despite the judgment of the Supreme Court nullifying the nomination of Emmanuel Bwacha the APC governorship candidate in the state. The Taraba APC Chairman, Ibrahim El-Sudi, made this known during a live appearance on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Friday. El-Sudi also said the party had accepted that no primary election was held in the state since the court stated so, adding that “we cannot say otherwise. That is the position of the Supreme Court and we are bound by it.” READ ALSO: Supreme Court Sacks Bwacha As Taraba APC Governorship Candidate El-Sudi, who said the apex court’s decision does not hinder the party, explained that, “The Supreme Court decision doesn’t stop anything because it is the right of an individual to go to court and they have exhausted it. And the Supreme Court has now ordered that there should be a fresh primary election. “As far as litigation is concerned, we are not in control obviously; it is the right of an individual to go to court. It is his right to purchase forms and then contest. The constitution equally gives him the right to go to court and we have no control over that. “There will be a level playing field. And obviously, I am not the person to conduct the fresh primary election. “It is the National Secretariat that appoints persons to go and conduct such fresh primary elections. All I am to do is give them an enabling environment for them to operate smoothly and then come out with a result,” he added.

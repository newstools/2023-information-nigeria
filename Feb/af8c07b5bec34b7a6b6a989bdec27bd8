At a news conference Tuesday in Abuja, Alake said Obasanjo’s call was anchored on the unsubstantiated claims, rumours and allegations of fraud by opposition parties led by PDP and LP, who have seen that they have lost the election would rather want Nigeria’s hard-won democracy to be truncated on the altar of their lies. He added: “You must also be aware of the gang up by the PDP and Labour Party, whose agents walked out of the National Collation Centre in Abuja on Monday. Today, they continued their conspiracy to truncate our 24-year democratic journey by raising unfounded allegations against INEC, casting aspersions on the whole electoral process, forgetting the process had handed them unexpected victories in some states. We have always suspected that Labour Party and PDP are the same, only divided by individual inordinate ambition.”

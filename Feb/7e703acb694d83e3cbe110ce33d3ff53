I have the courage to lead and fight for the survival of the less privileged. “I am exposed enough to give the best to our people. In politics, people contest for varied interests. “Some of our contests are to see what value we can add to the lives of others and improve on what has been achieved. “Some other aspirants have also collected the form but I am the aspirant to beat as far as required support and goodwill across the state are concerned.” Adeyemi is currently serving a third term as senator. He was elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the first two terms and the third on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The legislator was a two-term president of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) before going into politics.

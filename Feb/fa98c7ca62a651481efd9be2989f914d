Popular Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw, has called out the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the failure of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to accredit her as a registered voter. Henshaw, in a video posted on Twitter, said despite her name being reflected in the voter list pasted on the wall at the polling unit, as well as on the electoral umpire website, the BVAS indicated that she was not registered. Her words: “You people are playing with my destiny. Yes. “INEC, I registered, I transferred my card and I picked up my PVC. Now, your BVAS is saying I’m not registered. But I’ve seen my name on the register pasted on the wall and on your website. READ ALSO: Ekiti Women Snub Polling Units, Display Goods On Streets “What are you guys people doing?

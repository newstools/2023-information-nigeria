Kayode Salako, Lagos Labour Party (LP) Chairman, on Wednesday, revealed reasons for his resignation as the party’s leader in the State. The former chairman, in a chat with Channels Television said he resigned to focus on his election as the party’s candidate for the House of Representatives seat in Oshodi-Isolo Constituency 1. Salako had resigned from his position while handing over the party structure in the State to Dayo Ekong as the new chairman. His resignation, he said, followed the directive by the national leader of the party, Julius Abure. “I am the candidate of the party for the House of Representatives seat in Oshodi-Isolo Constituency 1.

He added that Abure told him to nominate his replacement as chairman, and he (Salako) picked Ekong because of “her doggedness and selflessness in the affairs of the party in Lagos”. Meanwhile, in 2022, a support group of the Labour Party and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi accused Salako of working against the party in the State. The group, which identifies as Peter Obi Grassroots Mobilisation 2023 Movement alleged that he was working for Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress in Lagos and as such must be rooted out of Labour Party. “Labour Party Chairman in Lagos Kayode Salako is working for Tinubu. We must root him out of the party,” the group said.

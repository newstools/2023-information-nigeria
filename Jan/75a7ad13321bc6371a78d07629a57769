Nigeria’s elder statesman, Ibrahim Babangida has denied claims that he has endorsed Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for the 2023 general elections. In a recent tweet by a parody account (General_Ibbro), the former Military Head of State was quoted to have supported the endorsement of Obi by former president Olusegun Obasanjo.

No serving General in the Nigerian Army today joined the military earlier than 1982. By then, Obasanjo had already finished his military career. I respect him a lot, with his endorsement,” the tweet reads. However, spokesperson to the former military leader, Prince Kassim Afegbua, denied that his principal endorsed Obi, saying IBB doesn’t have a Twitter account when contacted by Daily Independent. “It is not true, please. Ignore the report of the endorsement. IBB doesn’t have a Twitter handle. “If he is going to speak, it will be through a signed statement, not Twitter. Those behind the Twitter statement are liars,” he said.

Former governor of Imo State, Ikedi Ohakim, on Monday evening, escaped death by the whiskers after some gunmen attacked his convoy. The gunmen were said to have thrown explosives at his back up vehicles when they failed to capture Ohakim. This resulted to the death of four of the former governor’s police orderlies. A source said: “His Excellency was the main target but his brave driver was smart enough to beat them because they were driving to block him. “Disappointed that their main target had escaped, they blocked his backup vehicle and burnt it. The four policemen with him were feared killed.” Ohakim’s media aide, Emma Chukwu, said: “I will comment on the issue later.” Police spokesman Michael Abattam did not pick up his calls.

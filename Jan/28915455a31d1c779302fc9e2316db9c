Nigeria’s oil output rose by four per cent month-on-month, MoM, to 1.235 million barrels per day, mb/d in December 2022, from 1.186 mb/d in November 2022. On Year-on-Year, YoY performance, the nation’s oil output also increased to 1.235 mb/d in December 2022, from 1.197 mb/d in the corresponding period of 2021. This was announced by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC in its January 2023 Monthly Oil Market Report, MOMR obtained by Vanguard yesterday. The report further showed that the nation succeeded in beating Angola, its close rival that produced 1.088 mb/d in December 2022, to become the leading African producer while Equatorial Guinea came last with 54,000 bp/d. Despite the increase, the report indicated that Nigeria did not meet its 1.8 mb/d OPEC quota during the period even though the nation has the capacity to produce additional 300,000 – 400,000 bpd of condensate. Meanwhile, the government has embarked on an aggressive exploration targeted at increasing Nigeria’s oil reserves to 40 billion barrels in 2025, from the current 37 billion barrels.

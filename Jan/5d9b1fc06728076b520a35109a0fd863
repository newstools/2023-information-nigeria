Former senate president, David Mark, has advised those who will lose in the upcoming general election to congratulate the winners, rather than going to court. In his New Year message to Nigerians, he called for an end to the politics of bitterness and urged all the stakeholders in the electoral process to rise up to the challenges of conducting free, fair, credible, and acceptable elections that will stand the test of time in February 2023. The senator said, “All the stakeholders—the Independent National Electoral Commission, the political parties, the security agencies, the media, and civil society organisations—should take it as a call to national service to ensure hitch-free polls. “I crave an electoral process that is devoid of irregularities. I hope for an election result that will not attract litigation where the loser willingly congratulates the winner. “This is the foundation and a sure way towards the socio-political and economic emancipation of the country.” READ ALSO: Man Knocks Down Ten Friends On New Year For Chastising Him Over Reckless Driving The former senate president noted that Nigeria had a tumultuous political history in terms of electioneering challenges and expressed hope that past experiences would guide the conduct of the 2023 elections. He expressed optimism that the outcome of the 2023 elections would be satisfactory to all stakeholders if all the actors complied with the rules of the game. However, Mark cautioned against electoral violence that portends grave danger for the country. To this end, he urged election candidates to educate their supporters against any act that could jeopardise the process. He reminded gladiators that, irrespective of different political affiliations, everything must be done to protect and preserve the interests and territorial integrity of the country, saying, “whichever way it goes, we have no other country than Nigeria.”

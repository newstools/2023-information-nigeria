Ousmane Dembele scored a first-half winner as Barcelona moved three points clear at the top of La Liga by edging to victory against Atletico Madrid. Dembele scored with a sweet side-foot finish following Gavi’s lay-off and also hit a post in the second half. Atletico could have levelled in added time but Antoine Griezmann’s effort was cleared off the line by Ronald Araujo. Both sides finished with 10 men after Stefan Savic and Ferran Torres were dismissed for fighting. The two former Manchester City players grappled each other off the ball, ending up on the turf, and were shown straight red cards.

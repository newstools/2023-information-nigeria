The Ondo State People’s Democratic Party, yesterday, decried the attack of its members in Idanre Local Government Area of the state by alleged soldiers. The party accused APC lawmaker representing Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency, Mr. Tajudeen Adefisoye, of planning the attack on its members and the destruction of shops where members were holding a meeting. Adefisoye, who is the Deputy Chairman of the House Committee on Army, had accused some PDP youths of attacking his convoy, last Saturday, in the town, injuring his supporters. The PDP alleged that the invasion by the alleged fake soldiers was a reprisal attack by the APC lawmaker.

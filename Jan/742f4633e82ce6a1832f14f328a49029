 A newborn is said to have been seized by a Unique Health Medical Center in Warri, Delta state, after her mother failed to pay a N383,500 medical bill for more than a month. According to The Punch, the mother of the twins, Mrs Akpesiri Ojiko delivered the two babies on November 17, 2022, at the general hospital Warri. Narrating her ordeal, Mrs Ojiko appealed to the Delta State government and well-meaning individuals to assist in upsetting the medical bill to enable her to have access to her baby. She said, “I give birth to the babies on November 17 last year, a male and a female at the general hospital Warri but the hospital management told us that they did not have bed space to accommodate the babies and they cannot keep the two babies in one bed.

We have paid N50,000 for my sister brought, then we will pay the balance of N383,500 for my baby to be released. “My baby is about a month and some weeks while I have not set my eyes on the female baby for a month now, don’t even allow me to see her. Please I’m begging governor Ifeanyi Okowa and others to help me” The Punch reported that the father of the babies, Mr Destiny Ojiko, a Keke operator who ran away earlier on hearing the N433,500 hospital bill out of frustration had resurfaced crying for help. The female twin cannot be released to her mother until the outstanding balance of N383,500 is paid, according to the hospital’s doctor.

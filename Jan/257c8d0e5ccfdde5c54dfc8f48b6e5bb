Giovanni Simeone’s late goal helped Napoli to a narrow win over Roma and saw them open up a 13-point gap at the top of Serie A. Victor Osimhen’s volley gave Luciano Spalletti’s side an early lead but Roma levelled through Stephan El Shaarawy. However the hosts, chasing a first Scudetto since 1990 and the days of Diego Maradona, pressed for a winner. And Simeone’s turn away from Chris Smalling and effort into the top corner proved decisive. Napoli now have 53 points from 20 games, with Inter Milan a distant second on 40 points after their 2-1 win at Cremonese on Saturday. Roma are sixth in the table, one point off the Champions League places. Meanwhile, defending champions AC Milan slipped out of the top four after suffering a 5-2 thrashing at home to struggling Sassuolo. Stefano Pioli’s side are on a four-match winless run in the Italian top flight and have conceded 12 goals in their last three matches in all competitions.

Juventus fell to a 2-0 home defeat to Monza to leave them languishing in 13th, while Lazio played out a 1-1 draw with Fiorentina to move up to third in the table.

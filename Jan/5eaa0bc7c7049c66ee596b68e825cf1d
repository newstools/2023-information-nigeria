Mohammed Maigari Dingyadi, minister of Police Affairs, has said owing to reforms initiated by the All Progressives Congress administration, the level of corruption previously attributed to officers of the Nigeria Police Force has reduced drastically. Dingyadi said feedback gotten from the public, especially from random surveys and observations in the marketplaces and other locations where personnel are posted, prove that the situation is getting better. The Minister gave this assurance on Wednesday, after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. According to him, FEC has approved a draft bill for the standardisation of various police training institutions in the country, which will be transmitted to the National Assembly for passage soon.

Explaining the rationale behind the draft bill, Dingyadi said its main objective is not to establish new training colleges, rather it is to boost existing police colleges, training institutes and other allied professional institutions across the country. His words, ” I must say that even before this policy proposal or bill, our findings have shown that levels of corruption have drastically reduced because of this government reforms. “One of the objectives of this bill is to improve the standard of teaching and learning in these training institutes which in the long run we are bound to have good output in terms of professional officers, by implication it will also help reduce issues of corruption.”

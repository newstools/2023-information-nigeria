Spokesman for the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Festus Keyamo, has labeled the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, an ethnic chauvinist undeserving of support from northerners. Keyamo, who claimed President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory in 2019 presidential election was connected to his honesty and forthrightness, described Atiku’s legacies as fraudulent. In a series of tweets on Monday, the Minister of State for Labour and Employment insisted that the former vice president is notorious for playing religious and ethnic politics.

No. Buhari built a legacy of honesty & forthrightness over the years. Atiku’s legacies are DIRECT OPPOSITES of these. “In the final days to voting, Atiku plans to unleash all manners of religious and tribal sentiments to sway voters in the North. Unfortunately for him, the North has since written him off as an untrustworthy and dishonest person not worthy of their bulk support.” Keyamo tweeted. Buhari, who first came to power in 2015 after defeating then-incumbent Goodluck Jonathan, crushed his main challenger Atiku Abubakar by a margin of nearly four million votes, according to results announced by the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC). In 2019, he was declared winner in the elections having polled 56 percent of the votes.

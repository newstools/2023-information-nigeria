Former Al Nassr forward and Cameroon international Vincent Aboubakar has reacted to the ‘Greatest Of All Time’ debate between World Champion Lionel Messi and estranged Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo as he set to leave the Saudi club. The striker is prepared to depart the club due to a Saudi League rule which states that a club can register up to 8 foreign players. With Al Nassr terminating forward Aboubakar’s contract after signing Ronaldo, the Cameroon international may have had the last laugh in the exchange. In order to include Ronaldo in the squad, the club would have had to release one of their existing foreign players and they were aware of it while signing the Portuguese talisman, the report stated. Aboubakar has mutually agreed to terminate his contract and will be compensated by the club, according to reports in France, quoted by the Daily Mail report.

Ronaldo will, however, have to wait until January 22 before he can make his debut for Al Nassr due to him currently serving suspension because of the time he smashed an Everton fan’s phone out of their hand whilst leaving the pitch at Goodison Park in November. Ronaldo has already sat out one of the 2-match ban during Friday’s 2-0 win over Al-Ta’ee and will also miss playing against Al Shabab on January 14. He will make his debut in the 14th round of the Saudi Arabian League against Al Ettifaq on January 22. Meanwhile, according to Saudi publication OKAZ, Manchester United are looking to bring one Aboubakar to Old Trafford in a short term deal.

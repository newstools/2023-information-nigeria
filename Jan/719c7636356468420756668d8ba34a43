Rochas Okorocha, former governor of Imo State and lawmaker representing Imo West Senatorial District, has denied joining the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) . Okorocha who made the clarification in a statement signed by Sam Onwuemeodo, his Special Adviser (Media), on Thursday, noted that those behind the rumoured defection merely went to town with a “false story” relying on a photograph of him and some PDP chieftains taken at a public ceremony in Imo State recently. The statement read, “Our attention has been drawn to a story claiming that Okorocha has joined the PDP. To add flesh to the false story, those behind it also attached some photographs of Okorocha and a chieftain of the PDP, Emeka lhedioha and others.

They could not also quote a portion of Okorocha’s speech that he must have made at the so-called event. They concealed or withheld those vital aspects of the event or story, because they would not serve their aim or goal. “We are at ease to say that Okorocha has not joined the PDP. He is still a member of the APC. A burial ceremony could not have become political declaration rally.”

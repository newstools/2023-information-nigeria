Nollywood actor, Alex Ekubo, has reportedly reconciled with his estranged fiancée, Fancy Acholonu, who recently tendered a public apology to him and his family. The couple got engaged in May 2021 and their wedding was scheduled to hold on November 27, 2021. Recall that in August of the same year, the model took to her Instagram page to call off the engagement, stating that “everyone needs to live their truth.” However, she later made a u-turn and publicly apologized to him twice, the recent one being on Thursday, December 29, 2022, which Alex eventually acknowledged. However, according to insiders and a video obtained, the couple were already back together even before the last Thursday public apology. Fancy, who is based in the U.S, reportedly arrived the country some days ago and has since been with Alexx at his mansion in Lagos Insiders also revealed that the “apology was just something Alex demanded just to repair his image which her public breakup dented,” and it was vetted by him before being posted.

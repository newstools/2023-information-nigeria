The Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council (LP-PCC) has explained how thugs allegedly attacked the campaign team of the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, after a rally in Katsina State on Monday. In a statement issued on Tuesday by its Head of Media, Diran Onifade, the council said the party’s campaign team was attacked after Obi had addressed women at a town hall meeting in the state. The former Anambra State governor, according to the council, was attacked by some hoodlums on his way to the airport. It further urged security agencies to investigate the incident to prevent future occurrences.

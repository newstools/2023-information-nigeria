Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Sunday declared that he is looking forward to occupying the Aso Rock Villa as the next President of Nigeria. The former Lagos governor while speaking in Benin, the Edo State capital, said he has fought hard for Nigeria’s democracy, therefore it is normal for him to look forward to succeeding Buhari. As a result, he told the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II that he was in the state to seek the ruler’s prayers concerning the 2023 election.

When you move out, I want to occupy the place. Therefore I need your blessings, that blessing is important to me.” Oba Ewuare II however appreciated Tinubu’s for his plans to support the Museum for the Benin artefacts which according to the traditional ruler, would help tourism and research.

The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) has commended the decision of some prominent Nigerian leaders in endorsing the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi for the 2023 election. COSEYL in a statement issued by its President General, Goodluck Ibem, on Wednesday, described the endorsement as a bold move taken by men of good conscience who want a better Nigeria. The coalition also spoke against the negative backdrop of the endorsement decision by former president Olusegun Obasanjo, governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State and prominent South-South leader, Edwin Clark, of Obi’s presidential ambition. These endorsements have continued to attract mixed reactions from Nigerians and political stakeholders in the country.

The group added that anyone against the endorsement is comfortable with the many challenges facing Nigeria including security and economic problems. The statement by the coalition reads: “Anyone who is against these men of good conscience is just telling Nigerians that he/she is comfortable with the price of fuel selling at N600 per litre, exchange rate of N720 for $1, insecurity and other social vices that have taken over the entire nation. “We commend the boldness of Governor Samuel Ortom, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, and Chief Edwin Clark to say the minds of Nigerians who have no means of doing so.”

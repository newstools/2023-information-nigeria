I note that this same thing happened at the ICC during the signing of the peace accord, and this is not fair.” The NPC leader assured that the committee noted his protest and asked that he leaves if he was not still satisfied. According to Abubakar, the meeting was organized to ensure  proper conduct of the candidates, their parties and other stakeholders, especially during the campaigns ahead of the elections. Present at the meeting were; Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC); APC national chairman, Adamu Abdullahi; APC Vice-presidential candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima; Vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Ifeanyi Okowa; Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party; amongst others.

Rrahmani restored the hosts’ two-goal advantage 10 minutes after half-time and from there Luciano Spalletti’s side were rampant. Georgian star Kvaratskhelia picked out Osimhen with a superb cross and the Nigeria striker headed in his 12th Serie A goal of this season. Elmas’ deflected effort completed the scoring, as Juventus conceded five goals in a game in the competition for the first time since May 1993.

A petition has been launched against Nigerian singer, Olawale Ashimi, popularly known as Brymo, over his comments about Igbos on his Twitter page. The singer had been under fire for stating that an Igbo presidency would only be a “pipe dream” due to the agitation for Biafra. Brymo had also maintained his stand, adding that he was not sorry over his comments, which were tagged “anti-Igbo”. In November 2022, the All Africa Music Award nominated Brymo in the ‘Song Writer of the Year’ category alongside singers from other African countries. As voting for the category is ongoing, some Nigerians have signed a petition to stop the singer from winning the award. Citing his “hateful messages” against the Igbos, the petition noted that not winning the award would send a strong message to the singer.

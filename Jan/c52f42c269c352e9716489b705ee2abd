 The Imo State government has reportedly appealed to the ‘Unknown Gunmen’ to resist the temptation of continuing the bloodshed. According to Politics Nigeria, the government also charged security agencies to leave no stone unturned in finding those behind Sunday’s murder of the Sole Administrator of Ideato North Local Government Area (LGA), Chris Ohizu. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday by the state commissioner of information and strategy, Declan Emetumba. The government’s message was in reaction to the killing of Ohizu by the Unknown Gunmen – a catch-all for the criminal gangs carrying out frequent bouts of attacks on southeast residents and government facilities.

This killing falls in line with the targeting of members of the ruling APC, government officials, and their friends. “Those previously murdered in cold blood include Orlu APC LGA woman leader, Jenny Rachael Okonkwo (Iron Lady); Nze Chidi Ejiaka; Barr. Darlington Odume; Nze Nwachukwu Igboayaka; Mrs Helen Nnakwe; Collins Okey Agah, Chukwudi Dimagwu; Eddy Ofuefule; all APC chieftains from Orlu, and many others as well as Emma Mazi, former IMC chairman of Oguta LGA. “It is unfortunate that even those who are quick to shout over insecurity in the state never found their voices to condemn these cold-blooded killings in the past and are not saying anything also on the latest killing. “Be that as it may, Government condemns this cold-blooded murder on a Sunday and appeals to the perpetrators of the dastardly act and their sponsors to resist the temptation of going ahead with this bloodletting which has plunged the state into the current state of uncertainty.”

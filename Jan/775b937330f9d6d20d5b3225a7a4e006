 Police in Kenya are investigating the death of young fashion designer and LGBTQ activist Edwin Chiloba after his body was found dumped in a metal box by the roadside near the town of Eldoret. The Kenyan Police revealed that a vehicle without a number plate was seen dropping a metal box on the road in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. A witness said they saw the box being dumped at the side of the road by a vehicle with no licence plates and then told police at a nearby roadblock. When the box was opened by the officers, they found the decomposing body of a man, described as wearing women’s clothes and identified as Mr Chiloba.

In a message to the Reuters news agency, police said they had arrested a male in Eldoret who was the “main suspect” but their investigation continues. Police do not yet know why Mr Chiloba was killed, but he has been attacked and assaulted for his activism in the past, according to his friend Denis Nzioka on Twitter. While stating that motive for the killing was not yet established, Police Spokesperson, Resila Onyango, said, “Experts are handling the matter.” Uasin Gishu Head of Directorate of Criminal Investigation, Peter Kimulwo, also affirmed that officers of the agency were already following crucial leads which may hopefully result in arrests. “We will tie up some information we have and that may lead to arrests,” he said. Amnesty International secretary-general Agnes Callamard tweeted that a full and independent investigation into Mr Chiloba’s “heart-breaking” killing must be carried out, “leaving no stone unturned”. Mr Chiloba was a fashion designer, and was praised by activist Njeri Migwi, who said “he embodied fashion”. She tweeted: “Edwin Chiloba was an amazing human. He was bold, passionate, his energy was immaculate. He embodied fashion.”

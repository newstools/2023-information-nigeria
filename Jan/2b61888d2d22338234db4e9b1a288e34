The association, in their statement further stated that they stand with Empress and shall provide full support in areas of counselling to help her recover from psychological and emotional trauma. “We have been in forefront of campaign of violence against women and we view the action of this so-called evil lover man as an act targeted at eroding her dignity and self-respect. “We call on the law enforcement agents to apprehend the culprit and ensure he faces the full wrath of the law for violating the right and dignity of Empress Njamah. “We urge her fans to give her their full support at this time. She will come through this stronger and better.” Recall that this past weeks have been hell for the actress, who has had her name smeared by her estranged fiance, Josh Wade. Josh had not only threatened to release her nude videos, but had held on to her passport and other valuables. Keeping to his words, he had leaked the actress’s nude video on a WhatsApp group he created.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) distanced itself from a “final list” of candidates vying for elective positions in next month’s election trending on social media. In a statement titled: “No Final List Of Candidates For The 2023 General Elections Was Released By The Commission On Sunday, 8th January 2023,” issued by its national commissioner and chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, the commission described the list as fallacious. The statement read: “There cannot be a final list of candidates with just 46 days to the General Elections except for names published as substitutions for candidates nominated earlier in compliance with Court Order.” The electoral body urged the electorates to disregard the fallacious publication, saying the final list of candidates for the elections was published in September and October last year.

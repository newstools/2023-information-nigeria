 Nigerian singer, Brymo, who has been under fire over the anti-igbo statement he made has tendered an apology. Taking to his Instagram page, Brymo stated that the whole drama started with Chimamanda Adichie receiving a chieftaincy title in her hometown, yet shunning a national award. According to him, he has been an advocate for Igbo presidency in the past few years and was only calling out the Ndi Igbo movement, which he is clearly not pleased with.

According to him, “Over 3 million innocent lives had been wasted from 1967 till date and properties worth trillions of naira belonging to Igbo of South East destroyed in the cause of Biafra.” “Politician can only give what they have in stock. Even if an Igbo man eventually emerged Nigerian President, such a President can never stop the much awaited emergence of the Republic of Biafra. Biafra is now or never. There is no amount of false hopes by these politicians to woo voters in the name of Biafra that will ever give anyone of them “a clear lead at the poll.” BIM -MASSOB said.

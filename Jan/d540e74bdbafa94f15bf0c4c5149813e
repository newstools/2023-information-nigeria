Real Madrid beat city rivals Atletico Madrid 3-1 after extra time to advance to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey. Atletico took the lead with Alvaro Morata scoring from close range following Nahuel Molina’s low cross. Real were 11 minutes from going out but equalised when Rodrygo beat three players and scored a wonderful goal. Atletico’s Stefan Savic was sent off for two bookable offences, before Karim Benzema put Real ahead in the 104th minute with Vinicius Jr adding a third.

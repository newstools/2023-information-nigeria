The Nigeria police have reacted to a video of a man who was recorded teaching a baby how to smoke. In the viral video, the yet-to-be-identified man was seen sharing the smoking substance with the infant. The Force Spokesperson, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, via his Twitter page asked that the information the man be shared with him on Tuesday after he was tagged to the viral video. Adejobi said, “Everyone of us can see this again. How did he get the baby? His son? Or niece or cousin? Whatever it is, mothers must learn from this. Do not entrust your baby to the wrong hands. Not everyone can babysit or take care of your baby for you. We need more info about him.” check the video below: https://twitter.com/IkeokwuChidozie/status/1612699806337740806?t=CUIq88YjHraZFF0AZfgUIA&s=19

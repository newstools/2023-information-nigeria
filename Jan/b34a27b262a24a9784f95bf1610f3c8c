Newcastle United frustrated Premier League leaders Arsenal to earn a point with a dogged display at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal were hoping to extend their lead at the top of the table to 10 points but found themselves drawn into an attritional and dogged encounter by a Newcastle Untied side with top four ambitions of their own. Chances were at a premium and Newcastleâ€™s Joelinton arguably wasted the best of all when he headed wide with the goal at his mercy in first-half stoppage time. Arsenal went close through defender Gabriel and forward Gabriel Martinelli, who both sent headers narrowly off target, while Newcastle keeper Nick Pope made a crucial late save with his legs from Eddie Nketiah. The Gunners also appeared to have a clear penalty claim rejected when Gabriel was hauled back by Dan Burn. The game descended into a scrappy affair with seven yellow cards with the deadlock unbroken. At it stands, Arsenal now have eight-point lead, although Manchester City have a game in hand.

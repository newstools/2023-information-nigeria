It was like a journey for us. We had kids and my last was six months at that time “We kept saying that we have to understand that, ‘this is the new us. Let’s go get the surgery done’. And when we go there, they said I was going to be on medication for the rest of my life. “It was a reality that we had to sit down. Them giving me a time that ‘you cannot miss my medication. As you wake up, that’s the first thing’, and telling me all of the side effects.” Silva also discussed how she was able to manage the dementia diagnosis of her husband, veteran actor Olu Jacobs. According to Silva, accepting her husband’s new reality helped her to manage the situation better.

That was how God planned it. We make choices in life, but eventually destiny is before God. “I was at the war front during the civil war, and saw how many died. Some fell right beside me. God kept me. “Many bridges were blown just before we arrived at some places, and after we crossed. I arrived at some places to see bodies of my own colleagues that we were fighting together. I am alive today only by God’s grace. “This opportunity to serve the nation comes from God. All over the world, Nigeria is known for its diversity, with different religions and cultures. “We are also known because we have a huge population of millions of people. For the President of Nigeria, at this time, to come from Daura is the grace and mercy of God.” Buhari also assured the emirate that he would return and settle in Daura after handing over on May 29, 2023.

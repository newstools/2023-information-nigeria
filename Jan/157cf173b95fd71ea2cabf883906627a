No fewer than ten persons have been feared dead and several others sustained high degrees of injuries in a fatal auto crash on Nnamdi Azikiwe Expressway in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. It was gathered that the crash which happened on Sunday afternoon at the Nicon/Gishiri junction section of the highway involved a Toyota Camry and a Mazda. Sources, who spoke to Vanguard news said that the crashed vehicles were coming from Kubwa axis in Bwari Area Council and heading to the city centre, but unfortunately crashed into each other. According to an eyewitness, Samaila Isyaku, about three other vehicles around the scene of the accident suffered collateral damages. He said other victims of crash involved people in the affected cars as well as those waiting to cross the Expressway and those prospective passengers waiting to board vehicles to their destinations at the popular junction. “We counted at least 10 dead bodies besides the numerous people that wee fatally injured. “The crash resulted from dangerous over-speeding and eventual loss of control.

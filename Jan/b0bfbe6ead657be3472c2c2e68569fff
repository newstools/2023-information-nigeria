 Nigerian media businessman Raymond Dokpesi was allegedly arrested in London on Sunday night on rape allegations, according to Met police. Chief Dokpesi, the owner of broadcaster AIT, was picked up at London Heathrow Airport as he touched down from a connecting flight via Frankfurt on Sunday evening. However, in an email response to questions from The PUNCH regarding the circumstances behind Dokpesi’s arrest, the Met Police in an email did not mention the PDP chief’s name. The mail read, “On Sunday, 8 January, a 71-year-old man was arrested at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of rape. The arrest relates to an allegation of rape in August 2019. The man has been bailed, pending further enquiries, to a date in early April. Enquiries into the circumstances continue. “Please, note that we don’t confirm the identity of any person who has been arrested but not charged.” READ ALSO: UK Police Release Raymond Dokpesi After Arrest Reacting to the allegation, a source in DAAR Communication said to The PUNCH: “Rape! It’s not possible. I am not in the UK and don’t have information on why Dokpesi was held and released. If it was a rape case, will they release him? It is the most unfair allegation against him. Where did the rape occur? Is it in Nigeria or UK? “If Nigeria didn’t fight, is it the UK that will fight him over rape? Those who are brandishing that false allegation should be able to say where the alleged rape took place. Those brandishing that nonsense are not fair to that man. “Rape! At what age? Something that he didn’t do at a younger age, is it at over 70 years that he would do that?”

 Chimamanda Adichie, a well-known author, has revealed that she is the first woman to receive a Chieftaincy title in her community. She also urged culture custodians to make sure that both genders are equally honoured. The award-winning novelist was conferred with a chieftaincy title by her hometown last Friday. Adichie, who hails from Abba in Anambra State, was honoured with the title of ‘Odeluwa Abba’. The Governor of Anambra State, Charles Soludo, amongst other dignitaries was present at the ceremony.

And to Igwe L.N. Ezeh, who has always valued education, for giving me the title of “Odeluwa” — ‘the one who writes for the world.’ (My father received the title of “Odelora” — ‘the one who writes for the community” and the symbolism means very much to me.) “I am the first woman in my hometown to be made a chief, and it makes me happy to know that more women will follow. Culture does not make people, people make culture. Cultures thrive when they best serve and reflect the people. Ours must become a culture that celebrates achievement, whether it comes from a man or a woman. “It was a day filled with joyful moments but the highlight for me was the sight of many children on the dusty road, laughing and waving and shouting ‘Odeluwa!’ Amongst them, I hope, were little girls with their hearts full of dreams who feel encouraged to keep trying, to keep going,” she wrote in an Instagram post.

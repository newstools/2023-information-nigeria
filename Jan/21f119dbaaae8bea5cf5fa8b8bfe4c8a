Manchester United Legend, Rio Ferdinand has slammed winger Antony for his performance in the Red Devil’s defeat to Arsenal on Sunday, claiming he ‘can’t beat anyone’ on the ball. The 22-year-old was largely ineffective once again for his new side and was substituted in the second half after failing to have an impact on the game. Ferdinand, speaking on his FIVE show, criticised the Brazilian, suggesting he is showing nothing like the form he produced at Ajax, convincing United to spend £86m on him. ‘He just doesn’t beat anyone and I’m sitting there thinking, “Was that always the way?”’ Ferdinand said. ‘I’ve seen clips of him when he was at Ajax and he was somebody who used to beat people.

Saka scored Arsenal’s second victory to put his side ahead at the Emirates, and gave his England colleague a tough time on the day with his impressive dribbling and direct running. The former United defender suggested Saka had Shaw’s ‘number’ on the day, branding the winger his young player of the year so far.

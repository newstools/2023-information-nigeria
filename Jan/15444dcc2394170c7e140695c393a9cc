Michael Achimugu, a former aide to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has alleged that his former boss is plotting to assassinate Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike alongside the G-5 members. Achimugu revealed this in an interview with Television Continental on Wednesday that the plot was brought to his attention by Atiku’s daughter in Yola. The whistle-blower claimed the former Vice President of Nigeria intends to carry out the killing if he wins the presidential election in 2023. Recall Wike and four other governors of the PDP  – Samuel Ortom (Benue), Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu) and Okezie Ikpeazu ( Abia) – had since last year pressed their demand for the resignation of the party’s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, causing crisis in the PDP. The former aide, who claimed his own and his children’s lives were in danger, promised to reveal more information later.

I’ll release the details.” The former aide alleged that Atiku has so much evil up in his sleeves and definitely can’t be trusted. “Many evil things surround Atiku, including terrorism, assassinations among others. I will roll them for Nigerians to see,” he added. Achimigu went on to say that he tried to reach out to Wike and others for protection, but that his efforts were futile, and that Atiku is a dangerous man who should not be underestimated. “Atiku cannot be trusted. I know what I am doing is dangerous.”

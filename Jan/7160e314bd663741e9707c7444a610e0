The Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has issued a revised campaign timetable indicating that President Muhammadu Buhari would attend the party’s presidential campaign in at least ten states of the federation. Festus Keyamo, the party’s campaign spokesperson, in a statement Friday, said Buhari would be available to wave the broom and mobilise voters in Adamawa (January 9), Yobe (January 10), Sokoto (January 16), Kwara (January 17) and Ogun (January 25). Spokesperson Keyamo also said the president would also be physically present at the rallies in Cross River (January 30), Nasarawa (February 4), Katsina (February 6) and Imo (February 14), adding that he will participate in the grand finale of the APC presidential campaign in Lagos on February 18 ahead of the February 25 election.

However, Buhari’s decision to rejoin the campaign has sparked excitement in the APC PCC, with Keyamo describing the development as the president’s demonstration of “further personal commitment to the election of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu”. “The PCC expresses its profound gratitude to President Buhari, the leader of our great Party, for his sterling and inspirational leadership at this time and for galvanising our teeming members and supporters across the country. “We urge our party faithful and supporters to turn out en masse, as usual, in the forthcoming campaign rallies. The zero hour is nigh; our spirits must be high; we must not relent in this collective march to our victory that is divinely ordained,” Keyamo said.

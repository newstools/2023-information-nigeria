Kola Ologbondiyan, the spokesman for Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Council, has tasked the Central of Nigeria (CBN) to monitor the distribution of new Naira notes following its deadline extension. Information Nigeria had reported that Godwin Emefiele, the CBN governor, in a press release on Sunday announced a ten-day extension for the withdrawal of old Naira notes in the country.

Ologbondiyan however, reacting to the development via his Twitter handle on Sunday, said Nigerians had Atiku Abubakar, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, to commend.

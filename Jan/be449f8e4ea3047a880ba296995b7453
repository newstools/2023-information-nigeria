Former Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has assured his supporters in the state that he will get back his mandate from the elected Governor Ademola Adeleke. He also expressed confidence that the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, will emerge President, after the February 25 election. Oyetola, who was received by teeming APC supporters on his return to Osun for the first time after November 25, 2022, paid a courtesy visit to the Tinubu-Shettima campaign office, Osogbo, where he joined the party faithful in an inter-denominational prayer session for the party’s success in the general elections. Speaking after the prayer session, the former governor said: “I am happy to be back in your midst after a long break with my family. I returned to your midst with good tidings and I am lucky that you organised a prayer to receive me into the state. “God has told me that he will do two things for us this year, we are going to retrieve our mandate and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu will become the president of Nigeria. “I know that you are scared by what happened but God knows how he does his plans. Everyone has his challenges. I served Osun wholeheartedly for four years without resting and God intentionally orchestrated my rest for a while. I wake up every day, eat sleep and watch Africa Magic, I have time to receive my children and grandchildren. I later went to the lesser hajj with my wife to give thanks to the Almighty. “God made me govern Osun well. Let our minds be at rest, nobody can scare us off this state. I want to implore us that we should work hard for the forthcoming election, it is very important to us. Continue to hold your meeting, don’t be distracted.”

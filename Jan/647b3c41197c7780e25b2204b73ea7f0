The court has since decided to jail him without bail, while the case in question continues to be investigated. Alves has denied the accusations made against him, which came on the back of a visit to a Barcelona nightclub, saying: “Yes, I was in that place, with more people, enjoying myself. And people who know me know that I love to dance. I was dancing and enjoying myself without invading the space of others. “I don’t know who that lady is. You arrive at a bathroom and you don’t have to ask who’s there. I have never invaded anyone’s space. How am I going to do it with a woman or a girl? No, for God’s sake.”

He added, “18 political parties are fielding a total of 15,333 candidates for all the elections on offer and we are talking about 1,491 constituencies where elections will be conducted. “We now have 93.4698 million registered voters. These voters are registered in a total of 176,846 polling units nationwide.” The spokesman revealed that the commission is not interested in the ethnic or religious backgrounds of registrants but in strengthening democracy. “When you begin to introduce religion and ethnicity, you put INEC staff members in a difficult situation. When you report facts, it helps the commission but when you don’t report right, it could endanger the lives of our staff members,” he added.

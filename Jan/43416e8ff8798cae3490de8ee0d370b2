Daniel Bwala, the spokesperson for the Atiku, Okowa Presidential Campaign Council, has denied allegations that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is using the face of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), to campaign in some northern States.

However, Bwala reacted saying that it did not emanate from the PDP. “That is not true to have emanated from us. Why I am saying that is because if you go to Bauchi now, people are even reporting that the Governor of Bauchi State is with the G-5. So, could he be behind that? Certainly no.”

A coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSO) on Friday expressed fears over alleged reports of missing Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and difficulties in locating them. The group also raised concerns over the inadequate level of voter education carried out by the Independent National Electoral Commission. While advising the commission to ensure free and fair election, the organisations said voter education was non-existent in some places, leaving the voters vulnerable to manipulation by some unscrupulous politicians who might want to take advantage of the situation. The CSOs also warned the judiciary against reckless granting of court orders, injunctions and judgements. The views were expressed during a press conference by the focal person of the Coalition of Nigerian Youth Groups, Maximilian Tashilani; Convener of Coalition of Civil Society for Good Governance, Okpanachi Jacob and chairman of Arewa Transformational Leaders, Yusuf Ibrahim. Tashilani said it had become imperative to pause and “take stock of where we are coming from, and where we intend to go as a nation.” He stated the 2023 general election was a deciding moment for the country, adding that well-meaning Nigerians must come together to uphold the unity, sanctity and integrity of the nation by ensuring free, fair and credible elections.

Moreover, such education equips voters with knowing their rights and responsibilities. However, our investigation has shown that such education embarked upon by INEC is inadequate. “They are even non-existent in some other places, leaving the voters vulnerable and at the mercy of unscrupulous politicians who tend to take advantage of the situation. “The difficulties voters undergo to collect their PVCs is unbearable. Aside the difficulties of locating ones PVC, there are also reports of missing PVCs. “Despite the difficulties INEC faces in discharging their responsibilities, we urge them to intensify efforts to ensure they deliver to the people a free and fair election by February 2023.”

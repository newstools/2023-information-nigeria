NOSCEF in a statement via its chairman, Ejoga Inalegwu, also expressed concern over the rising wave of insecurity in some parts of the region ahead of the general elections across the country. The statement released to journalists in Kaduna  read, “NOSCEF again expresses concern over the incessant killings in the North, specifically targeting Christian clerics.

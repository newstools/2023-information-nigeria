Nottingham Forest’s comeback point against Chelsea in the Premier League is a “step in the right direction”, says midfielder Ryan Yates. Right-back Serge Aurier showed terrific composure to cancel out Raheem Sterling’s goal with a fine equaliser. It is the first point Steve Cooper’s side have taken after going behind this season and extends their unbeaten home run to six games in all competitions. “To show the resilience to come back is very good,” Yates told Sky Sports. “I thought we were unlucky to not win based off the second half. “It is a step in the right direction. The manager just said ‘believe in yourselves more’ at half-time. It is something to build on – we’re not satisfied with drawing games at home but it is a start.” The point means Forest move above Wolverhampton Wanderers into 18th and are only behind fourth-bottom West Ham United on goal difference. Meanwhile, Chelsea, who have now only won successive league games once under Graham Potter since he was appointed on 8 September, climb above Brighton into eighth but are seven points behind Manchester United in fourth. There will be meeting with the club management to discuss Potter’s future ahead of the season. There have been some worry from the fans, doubting if the coach will be fired or not.

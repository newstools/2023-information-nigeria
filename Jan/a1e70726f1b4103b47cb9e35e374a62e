 Nollywood actress, Halima Abubakar, has alleged that she was pregnant on three occasions for Apostle Johnson Suleman, the General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries International. In 2022, Halima called out Suleman on social media while claiming they once dated. She added that the cleric also had sexual affairs with several actresses, including Shan George and Iyabo Ojo. On Instagram, Halima said that her life was in danger and that the cleric should be held responsible for whatever happened to her. “Please don’t worry about me. But you can hold Johnson Suleman responsible, just in case. You can’t do anything, though. Nigerians are aware. If anything happens, Johnson, it’s you,” she had posted on Instagram. However, in a recent interview, the actress claimed the duo dated for six years.

When I lost the baby, he was crying, you would think it’s real because he was shedding tears that I lost his child. “It’s crazy. I got pregnant three times for him. The last one got me bleeding…I had to take tablets to stop it.” Responding to how long it took the bleeding to stop, she said “For four years, I actually just came out since I have been in a long spiritual battle; the blood just stopped rushing, you won’t believe it. “He was sleeping with me even while I was bleeding. That’s the dangerous part of it, and he was telling me he couldn’t sleep with any other person, that’s why. “The whole thing took me unaware because I was naive and not a spiritual person. Even when I’m on my period, he does that (sleeps with me).” This is not the first time Apostle Suleman will be alleged o have been involved in a sexual scandal.

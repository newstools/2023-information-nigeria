Peter Abang, a legal practitioner has slammed a seven-day ultimatum on the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to prosecute the Director General of the Department of State Security Services(DSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi, over his role in the plot to frame CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele for terrorism financing or risk legal action. The lawyer, in a petition addressed to the AGF,  pressed for a full-scale criminal inquiry into the circumstances leading to the failed attempt to rope Emefiele into allegations of terrorism financing and fraudulent activities by the DSS. Abang further described the plot as baseless and oppressive, adding that the petition dated December 30, 2022, serves as a notice to commence an action for mandamus to compel AGF offices to arrest and prosecute all persons or parties connected, in the event he fails at acceding to the request within 7 days.

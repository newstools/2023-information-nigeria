Senate’s Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, has alleged that Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) are indirectly “working” for the victory of Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, ahead of the elections next month by splitting southern votes. Kalu, made these claims on Tuesday during Channels Television’s Political Paradigm programme. He noted that the voting base of the APC in the North-West and North-East geopolitical zones will remain intact, while predicting victory for the APC during the general elections. The APC chieftain also declared that he does not trust pre-election polls that had Tinubu and 18 other candidates behind Obi.

If the poll wants to be realistic, Kwankwaso and Peter Obi are working for us because nobody has touched our base; nobody has touched the strongest base of APC. The North-West and the North-East are our base “But come to the South-East, it is divided, come to the South-South, it is divided, it is finished with Obidients. Nobody has touched our base; our base is still intact; it is as good as anything,” Kalu said. The former Abia governor said Tinubu would win the next general election and the flag bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar would come distant second followed by others. “Let me give you what I think will come: Tinubu will come distant first and Atiku will come distant second and others will follow,” he said.

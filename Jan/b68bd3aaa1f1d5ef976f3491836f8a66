Brentford wrote another extraordinary chapter in their Premier League tale after recording a famous first win over Liverpool since 1938. An own goal from Ibrahima Konate and strikes ouifrom Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo sealed a remarkable 3-1 victory over the Merseyide team. Konate met the same fate as Leicester’s Wout Faes did on Friday night, inadvertently turning the ball into his own net for the opener (19), before Wissa deservedly doubled the hosts’ lead from a Mathias Jensen cross (42). Liverpool reacted into action after the break, following a dramatic triple substitution from Jurgen Klopp, in which Virgil van Dijk was withdrawn, prompting a change of shape and brief change of fortune. After week sixteen, Liverpool continues to struggle to make top four with just four points behind number four [Manchester United].Brentford in other hand, maintained good form with twenty six points behind Jorgen Klopp side. As it stands, Liverpool remain in number six (28 pts), Brentford at number seven with just 26 pts.

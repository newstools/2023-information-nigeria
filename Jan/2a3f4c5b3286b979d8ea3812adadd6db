 Award-winning singer, David Adeleke better known as Davido has updated his marital status on Wikipedia. The singer finalized his traditional marriage rites to Chioma Rowland on Thursday, January 5th. Following the traditional rites, Davido has updated his marital status on Wikipedia to reflect his wife’s name. The traditional wedding was previously done in his father’s house, with few family friends in attendance on November 6th, 2022. But due to the tragedy surrounding their marriage (death of their son, Ifeanyi Adeleke), Davido couldn’t perform his Umunna rites, and as such he and Chioma weren’t fully married according to the Igbo laws.

In photos and video posted online, Chioma’s dad could be seen performing the Umunna rites and umuada rites. The Umunna rites, or gathering of the extended families of the bride and groom, mark the second stage of an Igbo wedding. This meeting is important because the groom’s people have to restate their interest in marrying from the bride-to-be family, in the presence of her Umunna (direct and extended family, with family elders). Once consent has been secured, dates for the traditional wedding will be set and the bride price list will be sent out. The groom takes a few gifts such as kola nuts, palm wine, beer, soft drinks, tobacco, snuff and a goat which will be shared between the groom and bride’s family. See post below:

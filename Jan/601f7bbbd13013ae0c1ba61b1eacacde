 Precious Okoye, a Nigerian model, has emerged winner of the Miss Africa 2022 pageant, which was held in Calabar, Cross River State. Precious took the crown on Tuesday, ahead of Poelano Mothisi from Lesotho, who emerged 1st runner-up and 2nd runner-up, Tina Haimbala from Namibia. The event, which was held on the 27th of December, 2022, had more than 20 contestants and many dignitaries across Africa and beyond. Precious’s victory at Miss Africa Calabar makes her the first Nigerian to wear the crown. In her remarks, Precious expressed overwhelming gratitude to everyone, supporters, her family, fellow contestants and organizers for playing a vital role in making her dreams come true. She said, “I feel overwhelmed being crowned Miss Africa, as this has always been what I wanted for my modelling career. The platform will enable me to tell my story, empower the youths and fly my country’s flag with so much pride and I cannot wait to put in all my best to make you all proud.” According to her, emerging Miss Africa 2022 will give “me the opportunity to advocate for quality education through skill acquisition for the youths. I want to use my incentive to select 200 farmers that will be benefiting from my fertilizer initiative as this will support local farmers in Africa and enhance productivity.” She said further that her role will “help create effective job opportunities which will help fight hunger and poverty not just in my country, Nigeria but in Africa at large. My dream is to volunteer as a Nigerian representative at the United Nations (UN) which will give me a platform to be of service to mankind,” she added.

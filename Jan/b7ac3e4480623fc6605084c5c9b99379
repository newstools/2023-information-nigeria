The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress has questioned the state government for failing to provide security for the people despite Governor, Godwin Obaseki, being the Chief Security Officer of the state. The opposition party said this in reaction to the recent abduction of some train passengers by gunmen in the state. In a statement made available to newsmen on Monday, the state APC Publicity Secretary, Peter Igbinigbe, said “it is saddening to experience this especially when we are still basking in the euphoria of the new year.

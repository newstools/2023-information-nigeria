The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has cautioned Nigerians on excessive fasting on religious grounds, stating it can destroy the kidney. Mojisola Adeyeye, the Director-General (DG) of NAFDAC, who stated this in Abuja during a briefing, urged Nigerians to fast with common sense or pay with their kidneys. The NAFDAC DG also urged Nigerians to desist from patronising hawkers and street-corner sellers of medicines. Adeyeye said: “Kidney failure, liver damage, others, I don’t know how many have died in Nigeria due to substandard medicines and unwholesome foods.

Because your body has to have homeostasis balance, meaning the water level in your body must be enough to make your organs to function. Some people will fast for 10, 20 days, without drinking a lot of water. The kidney is being punished. “Now, if you put chemicals in it, it triples in an exponential manner, with damage to the kidneys. This is because the kidney does not have enough water to dilute and filter. “I fast but I fast with common sense. We have to fast with common sense, if not, we will pay it with our kidneys. Also, do not buy medicines from hawkers and corner stores. But medicines from pharmacies.”

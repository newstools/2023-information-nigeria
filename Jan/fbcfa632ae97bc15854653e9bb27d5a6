 The Department of State Services has denied reports that its personnel invaded the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) headquarters in Abuja. It was earlier reported that operatives of the DSS invaded the CBN headquarters and took over the office of the Governor of the apex bank, Godwin Emefiele. But in a statement on Monday by the DSS spokesman, Peter Afunanya, the security agency denied the report. Afunanya said, “The attention of the Department of State Services has been drawn to the false news making the rounds that its operatives invaded the Central Bank of Nigeria and arrested its governor, today, January 16, 2023. This is fake news and quite misleading.” READ ALSO: DSS Operatives Invade CBN Headquarters, Condone Emefiele’s Office Recall that Emefiele had reportedly been out of the country on leave, and had told the National Assembly that he was indisposed and could not appear at a hearing he was supposed to attend.

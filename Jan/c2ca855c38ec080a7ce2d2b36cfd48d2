Reverend Father Matthew Hassan Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of the Sokoto Diocese, has said that Nigeria achieved nothing in 2022. Kukah made this statement in an interview with The PUNCH, on Sunday. He rejected political speculations that a rerun of the 2023 elections would occur, saying “Let us run first before we talk about re-run.” He also called on Nigerians to work towards a free, fair credible and violence-free election in which votes would count. Kukah said, “The incoming government is yet to come, but I think all Nigerians now have to look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves if we are better off now than before.

I mean how many phases of our national life (in 2022) can we proudly want to remember with a lot of joy and celebration? “The people of Morocco, for instance, will look at how they beat Brazil in the World Cup. So it is left for Nigerians to ask how they feel about the year that has gone, but the future is now in our hands. “Hopefully, and prayerfully, we will have another round of elections and our hope is that we will have elections that are free from violence, and free from manipulation. The process now is a little bit clearer from what we are hearing from INEC. “I think the biggest challenge for us now is that we have elections that are free, fair and credible and we are able to live the results that it produces. “Let us run first before we talk about re-rerun. We just hope that the elections will be free fair and credible, so a winner will emerge. “I don’t think we should begin to talk about the possibility of a rerun or whatever because we are just heating up the system. I think we should just assume that we are going to have an election and a winner will emerge.”

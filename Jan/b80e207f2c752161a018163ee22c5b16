Yemi Osinbajo, the Vice President of Nigeria, will make his first appearance at the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign train of Bola Ahmed Tinubu today. James Abiodun Faleke, the secretary of the APC Campaign Council, confirmed the development in a statement made available to newsmen on Tuesday. Faleke disclosed this while reacting to reports that the APC has postponed its presidential campaign rally scheduled to hold in Kwara State today, Tuesday. A report had emerged earlier that the Bola Ahmed Tinubu/ Shetima presidential campaign rally slated to hold in Ilorin, Kwara State capital, on Tuesday was postponed. Saadu Salahu, Special Adviser on Strategy to AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, the Kwara State governor, in a statement on behalf of the campaign’s local organising committee, said the postponement was to allow President Muhammadu Buhari lead the campaign.

According to a statement on Sunday by the Special Adviser to the President on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, the award will be conferred on Tuesday, 17th January. Reports, however, emerging on Tuesday morning, refuted the claims, stating that the planned presidential rally in Ilorin will hold as scheduled. Owing to Buhari’s absence, Osinbajo, according to the APC team, will stand in for his principal at the Tinubu-Shettima presidential rally in Ilorin. “I hereby confirm that the APC Presidential Campaign rally slated for 17/1/23 will hold as scheduled. Please be advised accordingly,” Faleke noted. “President Buhari asked Osinbajo to represent him as he would not be available”, a top source at the Aso Rock Villa confirmed to PM News.

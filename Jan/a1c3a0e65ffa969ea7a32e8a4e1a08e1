All governments, especially in this era of rare currency, run budgetary deficits; this is an inherent part of modern government. The wealthiest governments run budget deficits, as do the poorest nations. “A budget deficit is not necessarily bad. Look at the Japanese example with high government borrowing and low inflation. The real issue is whether deficit spending is productive or not. Unproductive deficits that are backed by excessive borrowing of foreign currency.” Tinubu’s comments come amid backlash over President Muhammadu Buhari’s signing of the 2023 budget into law with a 10.73 trillion deficit.

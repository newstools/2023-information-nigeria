 Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has declared that to have made it through the numerous obstacles of 2022 is cause for celebration. Adeboye said surviving banditry, kidnapping, COVID-19, including surviving the “murderers wearing police uniforms” was worth celebrating. Pastor Adeboye said this on Sunday, January 1, 2023, during his New Year sermon. He told the congregation that they were survivors because somebody (God) was taking care of them.

Ebola came, I survived, Coronavirus came, I survived, kidnappers are out there, I survived, bandits are out out there, I survived, there are murderers wearing police uniforms, I survived. Go ahead, tell three or four people: ‘I am a survivor. Celebrate me,’ the cleric said.

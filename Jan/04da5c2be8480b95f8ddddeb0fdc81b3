Leaders Bayern Munich were held by Leipzig in a dramatic 1-1 game as the German Bundesliga returned following a 68-day mid-season break. Serge Gnabry hit the post and Leon Goretzka had a goal disallowed for an offside in the build-up. Bayern got the first Bundesliga goal since the World Cup when Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting swept in Gnabry’s cross from close range. But third-placed Leipzig rescued a point when Marcel Halstenberg poked in from Dominik Szoboszlai’s header. Thomas Muller almost won the game for champions Bayern – who had won their previous 10 games – in injury time, but drove just wide from 20 yards. They lead Freiburg by five points at the top of the league. Leipzig are one point further behind. The Bundesliga, which broke up on 13 November, is the last of Europe’s major leagues to return after the World Cup. READ MORE: Napoli Place €140m Tag On Osimhen Amid Links From Bayern, Man.

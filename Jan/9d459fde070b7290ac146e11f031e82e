They are only investing. If they get into office, they will loot the Nation’s treasury, which rightfully belongs to the people. Do not vote for thieves and looters! They are destroyers.” Reacting to his tweet, the actor revealed that he used to think that politicians were the ones offering money until he got into politics and realised people were the ones demanding money. Edochie said, “I used to think it’s the politicians that offer money until I joined politics and ran for office. “My eyes opened. It’s mainly the people that demand money from the politicians and put them in a tight corner where they must find money by all means to share or fail.”

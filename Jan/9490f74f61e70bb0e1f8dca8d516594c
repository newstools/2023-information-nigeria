A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Board of Trustees (BoT) and national caucus member from Abia State, Ochiagha Benjamin Apugo, has dumped the presidential candidate of his party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The elder statesman, in a statement to journalists in Abuja on Sunday,  declared his support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi and the party’s governorship candidate, Alex Otti, in the forthcoming general election. Apugo, while distancing himself from the governorship candidate of the APC in Abia State, Ikechi Emenike, said he would be backing individuals with a proven track record rather than any political party in the elections.

He said: “Emenike and his team paid me a courtesy visit as a chieftain of the party to inform me of his governorship ambition as well as the proposed visit of the APC presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to Umuahia, Abia State. “I emphatically told Emenike that the APC would lose both the Abia governorship and presidential elections, and restated my uncompromising support for Otti and Obi.” “APC will fail woefully in Abia State. PDP is already dead. I am supporting Otti. I didn’t endorse him (Emenike). I told him that APC will not win because there is nothing to show APC people. So, forget about endorsement,” he added.

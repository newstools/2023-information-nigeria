Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, the apex Igbo organisation, has appealed to the President, Muhammadu Buhari, to allow the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, address South-East citizens before the 2023 general elections. Secretary-General of the organisation, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, revealed this, adding that killings in the South-East would subside if Buhari allows the IPOB leader address them. Speaking on the activities of gunmen linked to Kanu’s disciple, Simon Ekpa, the organisation’s Secretary-General reiterated his stance on Ekpa’s plot to destabilise the 2023 elections in the South-East. According to Isiguzoro, “This madness of sit-at-home and incessant killings and insecurity we are witnessing in the Southeast can be traced to the continuous incarceration of Nnamdi Kanu, which Simon Ekpa is taking undue advantage of.

Joshua Kimmich scored a late equaliser for Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich at home to Cologne in a disappointing 1-1 draw. Ellyes Skhiri’s fourth-minute volley had looked as if it would give Cologne victory. But Bayern dominated from then on and Kimmich struck from outside the box in stoppage time to rescue a point. Bayern are four points ahead of RB Leipzig, who moved up to second by thrashing bottom club Schalke 6-1, with Andre Silva scoring twice. Silva opened the scoring in the seventh minute before Benjamin Henrichs drove in the second eight minutes later.

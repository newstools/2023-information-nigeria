 Abdulrasheed Bello, award-winning Nigerian songwriter, filmmaker and former husband to Nollywood star Funke Akindele, said he has reverted to Islam, his former religion. In an Instagram post he shared, the singer who was originally born in Islam which he dumped for his mother’s faith, revealed that he was lost before but he is now found. JJC wrote, “I was lost but now I’m found, O Allah, I ask You for pardon and well-being in this life and the next. O Allah, I ask You for pardon and well-being in my religious and worldly affairs, and my family and my wealth. O Allah, veil my weaknesses and set at ease my dismay, and preserve me from the front and from behind and on my right and on my left and from above, and I take refuge with You lest I be swallowed up by the earth.

May Allah (SWT) continually do new things in our lives. I pray Allah (SWT) Light every path we follow, gives us the Wisdom & Guidance to every step we take, bless every decision we make, and make us excel in all aspect of life & grants us & our family Al-Jannah Firdausi. Ameen. Jumat Kareem. Speaking to Muslim News after the Instagram posts were shared, JJC said it was God’s design for him to embrace Islam. He said, “I was born a Muslim – AbdurRasheed by name. My dad, Bello is a Muslim but my mum is a Christian. Back then I used to go Islamiyah but all I remembered about it was getting beaten. They used to scare us with hellfire so, I never practised. “It’s God’s design that I will return to Islam. I thank Allah for sparing my life. I am so happy I found Islam again because it has given me peace. It has given me direction and focus. I was truly lost but now, I am found.” See post below:

 Five migrants from sub-Saharan Africa drowned and five more were missing after their boat sank off Tunisia en route to Europe, authorities said Saturday. The Tunisian coastguard rescued around 20 others from the Mediterranean, according to the district attorney from the port city of Sfax, Faouzi Masmoudi. Boats were continuing to scour the waters off Sfax for any more survivors, Masmoudi added. Parts of the Tunisian coastline lie less than 150 kilometres (barely 90 miles) from the Italian island of Lampedusa, making them a favoured departure point for migrants ready to risk the dangerous sea crossing.

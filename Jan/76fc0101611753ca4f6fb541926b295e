Benjamin Mendy has been found not guilty of seven of the nine charges against him. The Manchester City defender has been cleared of six counts of rape and one count of sexual assault after a trial which began in August 2022. However, after 14 days of deliberation at Chester Crown Court, the jury has been unable to reach verdicts on two other charges against Mendy – one count of rape, involving a woman aged 24 in October 2020, and one count of attempted rape, involving a woman aged 29 in October 2018. The Crown Prosecution Service said it will pursue a retrial against Mendy over the two charges – rape and attempted rape – that the jury could not decide on.

Mendy held his head in his hands as the verdicts were read out. Manchester City released a short statement “noting” the verdict. “Given there are open matters related to this case, the club is not in a position to comment further at this time,” the statement read. Manchester City suspended Mendy when he was arrested in August 2021 and stopped paying him in September 2021. However, his contract expires this summer.

 Chimaroke Nnamani, a former governor of Enugu State, has accused the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) of violating his rights. His comment came barely twenty-four hours after the party had suspended him, Chief Chris Ogbu of Imo State, and seven other members for alleged anti-party activities. However, reacting in a statement on Saturday, Nnamani argued that his right to fair hearing was consequently violated, noting that he was not giving opportunity to make representations in any meeting.

It is reassuring that my political career is alive. It is not threatened. We are going into the forthcoming elections very confident. “My right to fair hearing was consequently violated against the clear provisions of the constitution of the party, especially in disciplinary proceedings. More importantly, the superior constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria. “I therefore, appeal to all of you to remain calm and law abiding, while we continue our campaign to a hopefully victorious conclusion”. He added, “I’m overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and solidarity to me across the length and breadth of Nigeria and even across the political divide since the suspension was announced.”

The Central Bank of Nigeria has re-emphasized that the January 31 deadline for the validity of the old 200, 500 and 1,000 naira notes remains unchanged. This is as calls from various quarters have poured in pleading and demanding with the apex bank to shift grounds and extend the deadline in order to allow Nigerians more time to return their old notes to deposit money banks, better known as commercial banks. But refusing to yield to pressure, the apex bank, via its verified Twitter page, insisted on Saturday evening that the January 31, 2023 deadline remains.

And we took every measure to ensure that all the banks were and are still open to accept deposits.”

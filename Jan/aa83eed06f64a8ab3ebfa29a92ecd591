President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed concern over the unconstitutional change of power experienced in several African States, saying, “I thought we had finally put that behind us.” The President spoke via his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, while playing host to a delegation of the Universal Peace Federation. Looking at his experience in the military and civilian rule, Buhari said that “multi-party democracy is the best system.” President Buhari pledged Nigeria’s support, “relative to resources, to help in stabilizing neighboring countries,” on the peace summit being planned in Abuja, to bring all African countries together before the end of his administration.

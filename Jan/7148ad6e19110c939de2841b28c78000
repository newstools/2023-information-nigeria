 Spokesperson for the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has said the endorsement of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, by former president Olusegun Obasanjo is bad for the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar. Obasanjo in his New Year’s greeting to Nigerians, stated that Obi has an advantage over the other candidates in terms of character, antecedent, understanding, knowledge, discipline, and vitality. In response, Keyamo stated in a tweet on Sunday that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the APC’s presidential candidate, was unaffected by the endorsement.

Keyamo wrote, “Quite within OBJ’s right to endorse anyone, but bad for PDP in two ways: 1) Atiku’s former boss does not think he deserves to be President this time around. 2) The little support OBJ gave PDP in 2019 and they failed, he has taken that away to LP. No effect at all on @officialABAT.” However, in response, Atiku’s Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, slammed Keyamo, saying, “It’s within OBJ’s right to endorse anyone. But it’s within the rights of Nigerians to elect their President. Were you in Ghana on rehab like your friend to have forgotten that the Obj-Atiku admin produced the greatest economic boom in the history of Nigeria? Those are the considerations Nigerians will make.”

 The Action Alliance (AA) has threatened to stage a peaceful protest at the National Assembly over alleged exclusion of its candidates from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) list for the 2023 general elections. Adekunle Omo-Aje, the national chairman of AA, stated this at a news conference at the party’s national headquarters in Abuja on Saturday. The chairman said that INEC’s alleged failure to upload the names of all the candidates presented to it by its leadership in spite of various court orders submitted by the sacked national chairman of the party, Kenneth Udeze, might jeopardise the forthcoming polls. “We shall move to the National Assembly on a protest and to submit our protest letter, to inform our lawmakers that, if the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, is not called to order, there will be negative consequential effects on the outcome of 2023 elections. “We shall use all legal channels to ensure we get justice against any form of exclusion from presenting our candidates for elections, and every such election stands the chances of annulment by law,” he said. Omo-Aje alleged that “Yakubu is covertly orchestrating a clandestine plan against the 2023 elections, and Action Alliance will not fold our arms and watch our nascent democracy rubbished and wounded.” He said that Udeze was the party’s national chairman up to June 2019 before he was suspended and expelled, adding that he emerged the national chairman after a national elective convention conducted in February 2020 and monitored by INEC officials. The national chairman said instead of Udeze to challenge his suspension and expulsion from the party internally and through the courts, he instituted several court cases urging the courts to declare him national chairman of the party but lost all.

Omo-Aje, however called on the Nigerian Bar Association to intervene in concertedly sanitising the legal profession by fishing out bad eggs among its membership. “There is a clique of lawyers today on our streets that neither cares about the ethics of the bar nor give credence to professionalism. “These lawyers sniff around for legal lacuna to exploit, not minding whether such constitute abuse of court processes or not. “In the course of our ordeal, we have seen a lot of these tactical unprofessional practices where lawyers are engaged by persons to sue themselves as if they were truly sued in real terms, ” he said. Meanwhile at a national congress held by AA in Abuja, Solomon-David Okanigbuan emerged the party’s presidential candidate, amongst others. But Hamza Al-Mustapha, the former aide to late General Sani Abacha, also won the presidential primary election conducted by the Udeze-led faction in Abuja.

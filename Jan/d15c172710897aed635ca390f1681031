Civil Society Coalition for Economic Well-being and Good Governance, a coalition of Civil Society Organisations have issued a 78-hour ultimatum to President Muhammadu Buhari to end fuel scarcity or face mass protest. In a communique issued after a one day meeting and made available to journalists on Thursday in Abuja, the group stated that after careful observation they realized that some chief executives of the government who owned Nigeria National Petroleum Limited were responsible for the endless fuel scarcity. They subsequently called for the sack of Group Managing Director of Nigeria National Petroleum Limited (NNPCL), Mele Kyari. The Coalition also demanded that the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipreye Sylva be relieved of his duties within 78 hours for failure to rectify the fuel situation in the country, adding that lack of compliance would lead to mass protest. The communique which was signed by Garba Danzi, Chairman, Ayodele Hughes, Secretary-General and two other executives lamented the difficulty faced by Nigerians over lingering fuel scarcity across the 36 States of the country and the Federal Capital Territory.

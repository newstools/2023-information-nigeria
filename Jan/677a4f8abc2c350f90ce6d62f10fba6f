It’s like we encourage them to share but want to police how they share their experiences. Pls make it make sense. “I hate that it’s women who sometimes try to shame other women the most. If someone comes out to share her experience, let’s do better by either keeping quiet if we don’t have anything good to say or be supportive. Stop with the “she’s doing too much”, let her do please.” she said.

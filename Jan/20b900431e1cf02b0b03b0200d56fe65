 Operatives of the Western Security Network Agency, Amotekun Osun Corps, have arrested a man, Yisa Aderibigbe, for allegedly raping two minors in Osogbo. Brigadier General Bashir Adewinmbi, the Osun Amotekun Corps Commander on Saturday, said Aderibigbe was arrested on Thursday, Jan. 26, after a tip-off by the residents of the area where he committed the dastardly act. The suspect reportedly lured his five-year-old and seven-year-old victims to an uncompleted building in the Akepe Area of Osogbo, where he raped them.

The All Progressives Congress (APC), Sokoto State chapter has accused governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of playing politics with the lives of his people. The State chairman of the APC, Isa Sadiq Achida, in a press conference yesterday, alleged that the PDP-led government was comfortable with the security situation and wants to use it as a campaign tool. He also maintained that the State’s APC will not submit to blackmail or threat in exercising their constitutional rights. Recall Tambuwal had accused APC leaders of not doing anything to help in tackling the security challenges in the state when his convoy was attacked recently. However, Achida said, “Aminu Waziri has been shifting the blame on the federal government, while in other states, governors have taken leading roles in curbing banditry.

It is a common sight, after each campaign outing, to see PDP hired crowd besieging the main entrance of the government house and mostly shouting unprintable words against the PDP Government, seeking their daily campaign settlement,” he said. Achida pointed out that part of the efforts by the security agencies was bringing political leaders together, to sign a peace deal, so as to ensure the peaceful conduct of campaigns and elections. Meanwhile, Achida cited that the convoy of the APC governorship candidate, Ahmed Aliyu, was physically attacked twice on different occasions by thugs allegedly sponsored by the ruling party, while on their way to attend events in Sokoto metropolis.

Femi Fani-Kayode, former Minister of Aviation, has belittled the chances of Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), of winning the coming elections. Fani-Kayode, who is the Director of Special Projects and New Media of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, stated this on Thursday, during an interview on Africa Independent Television. It would be seen on social media that the rise in the ‘Obi-dient’ movement has led to a rise in the participation of the youth in the political process, with many analysts predicting a possible victory for the candidate. Nonetheless, Fani-Kayode stated that most of his garnered support was just based on social media, noting his chances of winning the North were very low.

I can tell you Obi will get 2 per cent or nothing in the core North. “These are angry people who crawl out from under the rocks, go on social media and vent their anger. That is what social media is for. I don’t read comments whether for good or bad. These people have the right to vent their anger but I can tell you half of them don’t make the population of voters with PVC.” He further ridiculed Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party for being a serial contestant of the Presidency and warned Nigerians against voting him due to this factor. “Atiku has been trying to become the President since 1993 and has joined eight political parties in order to achieve his ambition — he is a serial seeker of the Presidency. “He simply wants to be President for the sake of being the President and I don’t think that is the type of person we should give power to.”

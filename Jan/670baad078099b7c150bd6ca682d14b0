 The Police Service Commission (PSC) has described as false an online report claiming that it endorsed the tenure elongation of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba. The rebuttal was contained in a statement by the Head, Press and Public Relations (PSC), Ikechukwu Ani, which was obtained by newsmen on Monday. Noting the alleged claim he said, “The online publication in a supposed interview with a commissioner representing the police in the commission, AIG Lawal Bawa, stated that the PSC commissioner confirmed that the commission is not against the extension of the tenure of the IGP. It went further to quote the commissioner as saying, “if the IGP feels that it will affect effective monitoring of the elections, let him write to the president for their extension, we (the PSC) have no objection”.

He added, “According to him, he told the online publication that it was the prerogative of Mr. President to decide. “The commission, therefore, wishes to state that it has not endorsed any tenure elongation for the current IGP. As a matter of fact, the commission was never contacted on this subject at any time. “The commission wishes to appeal to the media to avoid unnecessary sensationalism in an attempt to attract huge readership. “The commission will also continue to work to ensure an effective and efficient Nigerian police rooted in the rules and regulations governing its operations.”

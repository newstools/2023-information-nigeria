 Nollywood actress cum producer, Toyin Abraham-Ajeyemi has opened up on the rather strange spiritual story surrounding her birth. During a new interview with This Day Newspaper, the mother of one stated that she was stillborn and went on to reveal why she keeps her circle so small. In a chat with Vanessa Obioha, Toyin Abraham disclosed that her parents initially threw her away at birth because she was stillborn, and it took the intervention of a Clergyman to resurrect her. Toyin Abraham explained thus, “I’m extremely spiritual. One of the problems I had back then was that I didn’t listen to myself. I would hear the voice of the Lord, and I would see it in my dreams, but I would still want to follow my flesh.

I’m actually dada – those people that naturally have dreadlocks from birth. “Since birth, I have been spiritual. My parents told me that I was stillborn so they had to throw me away. Then there was a clergyman from Ibadan who came to the hospital and asked about me and I was brought back to life. I was told that I never cried or did anything until the day of my naming ceremony. “It was the moment they named me Oluwatoyin that I started crying as a baby. Again, when they wanted to shave off my locks they had to tell me it was the Holy Spirit because I didn’t want them to do it. “I decided to have a small circle because there was too much noise in my head. There is always noise around me, both positive and negative. I am not a careful person. My heart is so free. I am someone you can trust with anything. You can do whatever you want to do in my presence.”

Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), has denied reports of his alleged endorsement of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi. The leader of the group also known as Shi’ite, in a statement on Saturday, said the report was false and should be ignored as he had neither endorsed Obi nor any presidential candidate for the 2023 election. Viral reports had surfaced on Friday claiming that the Shi’ite leader had thrown his weight behind the former Anambra State governor, urging his members to get their PVCs and vote Obi.

I can confirm to you that there is nothing of such, though some presidential candidates have reached out to him, he has refrained from endorsing any of them because he believes the 2023 presidential contest is bereft of ideological leaning,” Marshal said.

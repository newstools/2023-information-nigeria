The Spiritual director and priest of Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria  (AMEN) Catholic Chaplaincy, Father Ejike Mbaka, has returned from monastery after eight months suspension. Recall that the Church was closed down earlier in 2022 and on June 3, 2022 the Catholic Bishop Enugu diocese, Callistus Onaga, banned Mbaka from commenting on political issues. Shortly after the initial ban was lifted, Mbaka still went into verbal attack on Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate, describing him as a “stingy man.” Following the outrage and condemnation that trailed the attack on Obi, the Bishop issued a pastoral injunction on attendance to Catholic Adoration Ministry Chaplaincy Enugu, and enjoined all Catholics to stop visiting the ministry till further notice.

However, on Wednesday morning, hundreds of Mbaka’s supporters were seen to have trooped out on the road to welcome him upon his return. Mbaka’s supporters marched alongside a vehicle conveying him to Adoration Ground in Umuchigbo Nike causing gridlock along old Emene – Abakaliki road.

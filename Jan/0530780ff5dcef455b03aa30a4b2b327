As he drew level with Watson, Jones pulled a gun from his pocket and discharged six shots at close range, Liverpool crown court was told. One bullet hit his intended target, fracturing a bone in his wrist, but another struck a 15-year-old girl who had been sitting down at a bus stop with her friend, aged 14 at that time. The bullet hit the teenager at the right-hand side of the back of her neck and exited through her chest. She was rushed to Alder Hey children’s hospital for life-saving treatment and was later discharged. Police said it was “an absolute miracle – and credit to the NHS – that this young woman has survived.”

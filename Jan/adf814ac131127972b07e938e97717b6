Over half of the world’s richest clubs by revenue are from the Premier League, according to analysis by Deloitte. Eleven Premier League clubs make up the top 20 in their Money League study from the 2021-22 season. That increase is largely down to the return of fans to stadia for the first full season after COVID-19 restrictions, with matchday revenue rising from 111m Euros to 1.4bn Euros.

That saw a total increase of 226m euros. Commercial revenues rose 8%, from 3.5bn euros to 3.8bn euros (£2.975bn to £3.23bn) but there was an 11% (485m euros/£412.25m) fall in broadcast revenue. Last season’s figures were higher than usual because of postponed matches from the 2019-20 season being played. Manchester City entered the top five for the first time in 2015-16, before topping the table last season. Their impressive form on the pitch has seen them win back-to-back titles under Pep Guardiola and they posted a Premier League commercial revenue record of 373m euros (£317.05m) – a growth of 65m euros (£55.25m) on 2021-22. Liverpool are the biggest mover, rising from seventh to third, to achieve their highest ever position and overtake Manchester United in the rankings for the first time. Their run to the Champions League final, where they lost 1-0 to Real Madrid saw them gain additional broadcast revenue. They also generated more than 100m euros (£85m) from matchday revenue for the first time, and were one of only five clubs to do so. Arsenal became the first club from English side to enter the top 10 since 2018-19, largely down to a rise in matchday revenue, while Leeds enter for the first time since 2002-03 and Newcastle re-enter. Both clubs have reported higher matchday and commercial revenue than many other English clubs.

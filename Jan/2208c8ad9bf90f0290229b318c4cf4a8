 The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) has confirmed the death of one person after a storey building collapsed in the Aromire area of Ikeja, Lagos State on Wednesday. The agency said the building formerly housed Kilms Mart, a supermarket but partially collapsed due to construction work by some unskilled workers on site.

A former All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Naja’atu Muhammad, has said the presidential candidate of the party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has “an emperor mentality” and cares little about the country. Muhammad who spoke in a programme aired by Arise Television on Thursday, had recently announced her resignation from the APC and subsequently pledged support for Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Reacting, the APC presidential campaign council accused her of being a mole, saying she had been sacked from the party before her resignation. However, Muhammad, who was APC campaign director in charge of civil society reacted to the comments from the APC, reiterating that she left the party because “Tinubu is incapable”.

Everything about Tinubu is about himself. When he wanted to contest, he said it is his turn. He wants to hold the knife that will cut the pie. It is not about the country but him,” the former senator said. “It is all about his ego and control. He is about the material and psychological control of the people of the country, particularly the south-west. “I have heard him say that when he sleeps, the south-west sleeps. That is his mentality. It is like an emperor mentality.” Meanwhile, Festus Keyamo, spokesman of the APC Presidential Campaign Council , in the early hours of Friday reacted to her claims via Twitter saying: “Now, this is the point: since this lady already told Nigerians earlier that @officialABAT has dementia and then later turns around to say he has ‘emperor mentality’ & ‘seeks to control Nigerians’ which are attributes of a sharp mind, the question is, who really has dementia now?”

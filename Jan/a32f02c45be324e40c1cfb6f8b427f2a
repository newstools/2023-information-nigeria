The Bauchi State coordinator of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Babayo Liman, has defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Liman, who announced his defection at a press conference in Bauchi on Monday said he dumped the party due to lack of structure to win elections. The NNPP North-East Zonal Secretary said: “I want to formally inform the general public, especially members of the NNPP in Bauchi State, North-East and Nigeria at large, that I have resigned as a member of the NNPP. “I have also resigned as the Zonal Secretary of the North-East as well as member and coordinator of the Presidential Campaign Council of the NNPP presidential candidate, Dr Rabiu Kwnkwaso.

Liman said the NNPP’s leadership poorly managed its affairs resulting to emergence of various factions, adding that he ditched the NNPP alongside large numbers of his supporters. He said that his decision to switch camp also stemmed from internal crisis, flagrant disregard of the rule of law and lack of unity among members due to poor leadership of the party. He, therefore, convassed votes for the PDP and its candidates at all levels in the forthcoming election.

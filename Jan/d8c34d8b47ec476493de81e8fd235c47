Dumebi Kachikwu, the presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), has called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to compel Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to withdraw from the presidential race. The ADC presidential candidate, while speaking to newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday, stated that the former Lagos State governor is “sick.” Kachikwu however maintained that there is nothing wrong with getting sick, but he won’t accept a candidate with significant cognitive disabilities embarrassing the nation and making a mockery of the entire political process.

Today, the same APC that failed the Nigerian people monumentally with a sick president has presented another sick candidate to the Nigerian people. “There is nothing wrong with being old or sick, as we will all get old someday. We will also all get sick at some point or the other. What I do have a problem with is a candidate with significant cognitive disabilities embarrassing my nation and making a mockery of the entire political process. “Senator Ahmed Bola Tinubu has no business being in this race or continuing this race. He has said it is his turn, and I agree: it is his turn to do the honourable thing and withdraw from this race. I call on his family, his party, the APC, and President Buhari to prevail on him to do the right thing.”

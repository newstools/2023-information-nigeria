One of the things I had said is if you have occupied that position and you have served your term, please go home and be like General Gowon, Abdulsalam, etc. Just be quiet”, the ex-minister said. “You had your terms. Let others get on. For you to create problems for us and then come back to present yourself as a problem solver is worrisome”, he added. He further advocated genuine examining of the Nigerian political system, adding that only a president with the courage and tenacity to shake the system can succeed. “I can’t believe in my life how a president can succeed if we don’t do something quickly about the system being presided over. We need a president that will shake the National Assembly, make tough decisions and change the system”, he concluded.

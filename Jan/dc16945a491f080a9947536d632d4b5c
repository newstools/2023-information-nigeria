It was earlier reported that Okupe was arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) at the Muritala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos on Thursday morning. The DSS asked the former presidential aide to provide court processes where he paid the fine option following his money laundering conviction by the Federal High Court (FHC), Abuja.

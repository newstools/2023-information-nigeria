 Nigerian singer, Olawale Olofooro, better known as Brymo, has tendered another public apology for his anti-Igbo statements. The singer had come under fire after he said an Igbo presidency would only be a “pipe dream” due to the agitation for Biafra from prominent people in the region. “As long as there (are) talks by prominent people from Igboland about Biafra, an Igbo presidency will be a pipe dream,” Brymo tweeted. Brymo, a supporter of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, also urged southeasterners to test the waters with the vice presidential slot before aiming for the presidency. His comments had sparked negative reactions on social media, with many tagging him a tribal bigot saying he is “Igbophobic.” READ ALSO: Brymo Apology Over Anti-Igbo Statement, Blames Chimamanda Adichie (Video) Brymo, however, issued an apology via his Instagram on Friday night Going live on the social media platform, he said the issue started after he shared his opinion about author, Chimamanda Adichie, refusing national honours but accepting a chieftaincy title in her hometown, Abba, Anambra State.

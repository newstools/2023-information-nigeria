Labour Party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has described the country’s fuel subsidy as an organised crime, while promising to remove the subsidy immediately if elected the next president in the February election. Obi in a tweet on Sunday said that no reasonable country will spend more on subsidising a product than it spends on education, health and other major sectors of the economy. “Fuel subsidy is an organised crime and I will remove it immediately, if I am elected President. “Which reasonable country will spend more on subsidy than Education, Health etc. – PO. Meanwhile, Obi also said this on Sunday at the People’s Town Hall 2023 organised by Channels Television.

Subsidy, I have said it before, is organised crime and I will not allow it to stay a day longer,” Obi said. “What they are telling you is not what it is. Half of what is being mentioned is not subsidy. First is that we consume the quantity that is not supposed to be consumed here. We have the same population as Pakistan. They consume below 50 per cent of what we consume. “So, the first half, I will remove it and give those people who are drinking it water, because that’s what they’re supposed to drink, so we can save the money.” Obi further said he will also dismantle confusion in the ports’ administrations in order to get the country working. “We are going to dismantle the confusion in the Ports Administration and get this country to work,” he said.

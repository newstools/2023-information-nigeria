 Jamaica’s Olympic sprinting icon, Usain Bolt has lost millions of dollars in his account with Stocks and Securities Ltd, an investment company based in Kingston. The lawyers of the track star said they are prepared to file a lawsuit if that will make it possible to recover the $12 million that mysteriously disappeared from Bolt’s account. According to a statement from Bolt’s lawyers, it read, “The account was part of Bolt’s retirement and lifetime savings. “It’s distressing news for anyone, and certainly in the case of Mr Bolt, who established this account as part of his private pension,” Gordon said on Wednesday. “We will be going to court with the matter” if the company does not return the funds,” his lawyer, Linton P. Gordon, told Fortune magazine over the phone. “It is a grave disappointment, and we are hoping that the matter will be resolved in a way that Mr Bolt will recover his money and be able to live in peace,” he added.

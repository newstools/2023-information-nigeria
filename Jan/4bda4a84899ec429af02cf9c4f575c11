Cristiano Ronaldo’s new club Al Nassr say his contract does not include any commitment to back a Saudi Arabia bid to host the 2030 World Cup. Reports claimed Ronaldo will earn 200m euros (£177m) to promote the bid on top of his annual salary of £177m. But the club said his deal “does not entail commitments to any World Cup bids”. “His main focus is on Al Nassr and to work with his team-mates to help the club achieve success,” they added.

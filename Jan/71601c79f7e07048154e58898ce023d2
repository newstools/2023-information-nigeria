No fewer than eight Arsenal fans have been arrested in the Uganda city of Jinja after celebrating the Gunners’ win against Manchester United in the English Premier League. The fans were  spotted wearing the club’s red jersey and carrying a symbolic trophy to celebrate 3-2 victory at Emirates Stadium yesterday. Police said they didn’t have a permit to hold the procession which is a public order offence. Arsenal fans were travelling in a convoy of five vehicles on Monday morning when they were intercepted by police. One of them was carrying a trophy they had bought at a local store. “I don’t know what we have done but we were simply celebrating our victory over rivals Manchester United,” Arsenal fan Baker Kasule was quoted as saying by the local Daily Monitor news site.

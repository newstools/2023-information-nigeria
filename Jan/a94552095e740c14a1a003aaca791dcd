National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, in a statement Friday, said, “The people of Oyo State have again demonstrated their sobriquet as pacesetter in the politics of Nigeria by establishing that power lies in the will of the people and not the endorsement or dictates of any person or group of persons. “The PDP counsels those seeking to dictate to Nigerians on their electoral preferences to retrace their steps, especially now that it is clear that the people are not ready to be swayed by personal, group or sectional considerations in their support for Atiku Abubakar and the PDP.” READ ALSO: 2023: G5 Has Not Reached Deal With Anyone – Wike The PDP also hailed the people of Oyo State for their courage to support Atiku and other candidates of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. “The overwhelming chanting of “Atiku!

Kenneth Okonkwo, the spokesperson of the Labour Party (LP) presidential campaign council, has slammed the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for accusing President Muhammadu Buhari of plotting to scuttle the forthcoming election. Information Nigeria had reported that Tinubu, during a campaign rally in Ogun State on Wednesday, told supporters that the redesigning of the new Naira notes and fuel scarcity are all attempts to sabotage the election, but he will still win the election. However, Okonkwo, via a post on his social media page, said Nigerians can no longer tolerate the disunity in APC whose candidate is accusing Buhari of bad policies and insincerity of purpose. According to him, Tinubu’s assessment shows that Buhari has woefully failed Nigerians and has become a threat to the country’s democracy, adding that the APC, its leaders and the presidential candidate, have become a shame and embarrassment to Nigerians.

Could Tinubu be accusing Buhari of planning to stay in power beyond May 29th? Shame to APC!! “Nigerians can no longer tolerate an incompetent and disunited ruling party, APC, whose Leader Tinubu is accusing the President of bad policies and insincerity of purpose. This means that by Tinubu’s assessment, President Buhari has failed Nigerians woefully and has become a threat to our democracy. “The truth is that APC and all its leaders especially its candidate have become a shame and embarrassment to Nigerians. “Vote out the confused, disunited and shameless APC and vote wisely for Peter Obi of Labour Party for a new Nigeria.”

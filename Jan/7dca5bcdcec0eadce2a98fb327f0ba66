 Boko Haram leaders have reportedly killed 300 fighters and their families for attempting to surrender in Borno State. This was according to the Special Adviser to the Borno State Government on Security Affairs, Brig. Gen. Ishaq Abdullahi. Abdullahi stated that the die-hard Boko Haram commanders resorted to killing any terrorist attempting to flee the Sambisa forest to surrender in order to frustrate the ongoing peace dialogue between government and the terror group.

Abdullahi added, “This makes it easy for us to speak with them and persuade them to drop their weapons and embrace peace.” He also disclosed that the violent clashes between the Islamic State of West African Province and Boko Haram had played a key role in the success recorded in the war against terror in Borno. Abdullahi said, “So, any surrendered Boko Haram you see in the camp now risked his life to come out of the Sambisa forest.: “It is so bad that the commanders are killing the children, women, and the disabled to instill fear in them to deter them from surrendering.”

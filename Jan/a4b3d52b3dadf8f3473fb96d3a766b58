Primate Elijah Ayodele, the leader of the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church,  has said a prominent candidate in the forthcoming 2023 elections would kick the bucket if the concerned person doesn’t step down to care for his health. The cleric disclosed that the prominent personality is amongst governors, senators and house of representatives members. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, Ayodele revealed his fear. “My fear in the next election is that Nigeria will lose a prominent person among the governors, senators and rep members they will be voting for.

According to him, Nigerians need to choose someone who will put the country together. He also maintained that the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) is the only solution to having a credible election. ‘’INEC must take this election seriously more than what they have been doing, we can’t withstand any rigging because we are in a dilemma and we need to elect who will put the country together. BVAS is the answer to have a credible election and INEC must put in all efforts to ensure it happens.’’ he said.

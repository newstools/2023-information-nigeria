The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has confirmed that talks are ongoing with 11 other political parties who have approached them for a working alliance, ahead of the February 25 presidential election. This is coming shortly after similar chats took place between the ruling All Progressives Congress and other smaller parties. Ibrahim Abdullahi, the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, disclosed this on Wednesday in an interview with Punch. He said, “There are a good number of them, but it will not be wise to publicly list them out. At the last time I checked, we were in talks with over 11 of them.

Anthony Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn has admitted that Joshua’s career will be over if he loses his next fight. The British-Nigeria born fighter is set to step back in the ring on April 1 for a comeback bout at the O2 Arena. He recently suffered back-to-back defeats to Oleksandr Usyk, making it three losses in his last five after being beaten by Andy Ruiz Jr in the first of their two clashes.

However, the pressure is on because if AJ was to lose to a potential lesser-known opponent then his promoter believes his career is finished. Hearn said to iFL TV: “You go into that fight in April and you know that defeat, it’s all over, really. “It would be a third back-to-back defeat and yet a great performance and a showroom knockout will get everyone saying, ‘We’re back, baby.’ “That’s what I can’t wait for because I love it when our backs are against the wall. “I’m excited. I’m really excited. This is the most excited I’ve been in Joshua’s journey so far.” The Watford-born heavyweight has been linked with facing his ex-sparring partner Demsey McKean in April.

Marcus Rashford scored for a fifth successive game as Manchester United increased the pressure on Everton boss Frank Lampard with a deserved FA Cup victory at Old Trafford. Everton were applauded off by their travelling support for showing admirable character, after their side suffered the shock of going behind after just three minutes when Brazil’s Antony turned home Rashford’s far-post cross but had the character to fight back. Conor Coady rammed home a 13th-minute equaliser when David de Gea calamitously allowed Neal Maupay’s apparently harmless cross to roll though his legs as he appeared to think it was about to hit the outside of his post. Even after Alex Iwobi was stretchered off in obvious pain after he suffered an ankle injury in a tackle with Tyrell Malacia, Lampard’s players continued to battle hard. But once some brilliant approach play from Rashford had deceived Coady into turning the forward’s cross into his own net, the visitors’ character alone was not enough. And after Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a goal ruled out for offside, man-of-the-match Rashford kept his nerve to beat England international team-mate Jordan Pickford from the spot deep into injury time to score for the fifth successive game for the first time in his club career.

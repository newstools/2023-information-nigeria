Anthony Ehilebo, the head of New Media for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has slammed a former aide to the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, Michael Achimugu, over his recent allegations against Atiku. Recall Achimugu has been releasing audios of Atiku’s alleged corruption and dealings, urging Nigerians not to vote for the former vice-president. Ehilebo, while speaking on the allegations with Daily Post, urged Nigerians to ignore Achimugu, stressing that the whistleblower’s character is questionable. Maintaining that Achimugu is destroying himself and not Atiku’s presidential ambition, he said: “This is the same person who had accused me of betraying Atiku Abubakar and I told him I will never do that. See the same person accusing me at some point that I was going to betray Atiku; see what he has done to himself.

This is someone who had written a book about Atiku Abubakar; just because he is not getting what he wants, he quickly ran to the media to do his usual job of blackmail. Everybody knows that anyone who has something to do with doing business in Colombia has a questionable character. ”I wish I could be put on a podium with him and will tell him the truth. I will tell him to his face that he can no longer be trusted. ”Nobody will trust him again. How can you even be recording a normal conversation? And there is absolutely nothing in that conversation. Nothing. ”He thinks he is destroying Atiku Abubakar, but he has destroyed himself. I’m sure he knows that.”

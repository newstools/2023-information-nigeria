Mahmud Mohammed Wafa, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Gombe State, has withdrawn his membership and joined the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP). Wafa who is the Auditor General (AG) of the PDP in the Gombe Local Government Area of the state, said the party is currently in a confused state and cannot provide the leadership needed in the state. The AG said his defection was influenced by the failure of the PDP to resolve its internal cracks and issues following the conduct of its primary election in 2022. He further condemned the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe, saying the party spare headed an unacceptable leadership style in the state.

The politician however confirmed his allegiance to the NNPP during a meeting with the party’s gubernatorial candidate, Khamis Ahmed Mailantarki, in the State. Wafa revealed that he joined the NNPP to rescue the state from the APC-led government that had downgraded the state to a hopeless situation. “It’s obvious with his track records and humility, Mailantarki will provide better leadership in the state compared with those in APC and PDP and NNPP is the only platform that we can leverage to stabilise the state beyond 2023,” Wafa further stated.

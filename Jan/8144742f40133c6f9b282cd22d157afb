  Peter Obi, the Labour Party’s (LP) presidential candidate, has said those who are spreading the notion that he is stingy are those who feel threatened by his commitment to enforce fiscal discipline in the use of public funds. He also debunked claims that he was stingy in nature. Obi said this while speaking as a special guest in a programme at the Human Rights Radio popularly called Berekete Radio, in Abuja, on Monday. Obi explained that the perception about him being stingy is his fiscal discipline in the management of public funds and those who lose out in the blockage of waste consider this as being stingy. According to him, ordinary Nigerians have critical roles to play in the selection process of who govern this country and they can only do that through their Permanent Voters Card.

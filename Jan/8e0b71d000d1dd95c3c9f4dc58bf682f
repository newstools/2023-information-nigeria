 The Sokoto State Command of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has said it has arrested four suspected bandits in connection with the killing of Lawali Agajiba, identified as ward chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. The Command’s spokesperson, Sanusi Abubakar, who disclosed this on Tuesday in a statement, dispelled the rumours that Agajiba’s killing had anything to do with politics. Abubakar said the command received a report on December 31, 2022, of suspected bandits who invaded Gidan Huloti, Tungar Maza, Galadi and Agajibi villages in the Gwadabawa Council area that rustled a large number of cattle and sheep belonging to different households in the said villages. According the spokesperson, the bandits shot dead Agajiba, during the attack, who was later found to be the ward chairman of the APC.

Four members of the syndicate were arrested while transporting some of the rustled livestock.” The command noted that it had already contacted the council chairmen of Tangaza, Ilella and Bodinga, asking them to inform members of the public whose livestocks are missing to come forward to retrieve with proof of ownership. “The command also seeks the public to provide more credible information on the suspects under investigation as well as others yet to be arrested. “It was purely an act perpetrated by rampaging cattle rustlers who had no boundaries,” he added.

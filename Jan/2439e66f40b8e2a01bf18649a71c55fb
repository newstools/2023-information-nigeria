Aisha Yesufu, Nigerian socio-political activist has stated that Nigeria’s next president must be one who listens and is willing to concentrate on important tasks. The social critic also hinted that in the event that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi wins the 2023 election, her role would be advisory, as the position “does not require an office”. Yesufu, a top campaigner for the former Anambra State governor while responding to a supporter who said after the 2023 election, she will “collect our office” revealed that “one can work without being in office.” “The role I would play InshaAllah does not require an office. It just requires a leader that wants to hear how he should cut the crap and focus on the work that needs to be done,” she wrote via her verified Twitter handle.

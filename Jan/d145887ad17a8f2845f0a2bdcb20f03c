Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), has lost Yusuf Babangida, a lawmaker representing Gwale Local Government in the Kano State House of Assembly, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Babangida who previously belonged to the NNPP was considered by Kwankwaso, as one of his closest political ally. Through a letter of resignation dated January 7th and addressed to the NNPP chairman in the Sani Mainagge ward of the Gwale Local Government Area, Babangida said his decision to leave the party was motivated by the NNPP’s flagrant contempt for internal democracy. “All democratic ideals upon which my political journey has been anchored.

The lawmaker stressed that by allowing such injustice to prevail within the party, the NNPP offered him no choice but to abandon the party and pursue the continuation of his political journey elsewhere.

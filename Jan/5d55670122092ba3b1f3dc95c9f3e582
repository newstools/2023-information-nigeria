Hundreds of people including artisans and members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Kwara State, on Sunday, gathered across their parks to burn the branded caps of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ilorin. Red PDP caps, branded with ‘O’su wa,’ meaning we are tired, were earlier given by the PDP leaders to the transporters to seek their support for the 2023 gubernatorial elections in the state. However, the transporters, led by the Chairman of the Task Force committee of the union in the state, Alh. Taiye Olose, said they were burning the caps to show that the PDP led by former senate president, Senator Bukola Saraki, was rejected to reclaim the reigns of leadership in the state. According to him, PDP has nothing new to offer Kwarans after ruling for 16 years with nothing to show for it before they were sent packing in the 2019 polls. “Ko su a wa o (we are not tired),” Olose said repeatedly while burning the ‘O su wa’ caps amidst cheers from his colleagues at Post Office, Ilorin. Others were heard saying “Ko su wa o. Ramoni, Maa se lo,” as they were joyfully scrambling for the blue caps with the logo of APC. Various transport unions in the state have severally commended the Kwara State Government on good governance and support for their members in the last three years. There are feelers in the town that artisans and transporters have decided to reject the PDP and support the APC in the 2023 polls in Kwara. At different parks in Ilorin on the eve and New Year Day, the transporters sang in solidarity with the incumbent Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq who is also the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara.

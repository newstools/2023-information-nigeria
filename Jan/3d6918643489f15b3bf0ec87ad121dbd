According to a resident of Kafin Koro, identified as Jonathan, the incident began when some women comprising Evangelical Church Winning All and Catholic women groups converged on the premises of the burnt Parish at 7 am on Tuesday to offer prayers against those who burnt the Catholic priest. He said, “As the women were praying, some policemen arrived at the venue saying they were a detachment from the Kafin-koro Police Division drafted to the church to provide protection for them. “The women rejected the protection and requested that the police should leave because the police didn’t provide protection for the dead priest neither did they show up on time when they were called.” READ ALSO: Niger Governor Sani Bello Orders Security Agencies To Find Killers Of Catholic Priest Jonathan said when the police refused to leave the residence of the late priest, the women threw stones and sachet water at them, after which they left the premises.

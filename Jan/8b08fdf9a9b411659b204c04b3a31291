Mikel Arteta has warned Arsenal fans that Gabriel Jesus is still far away from a return, following surgery on his knee.

He was initially expected to miss up to three months of action before returning for the Premier League leaders towards the end of February or early March.

Jesus has shown himself throwing away his crutches and his knee braces. But ahead of Sunday’s north London derby, Arteta told fans to remain patient over their No 9. ‘I’d like to see him very quickly but I don’t think it’s going to happen. We’re going have to be patient with that one,’ Arteta said. ‘It’s a complicated surgery, in any surgery there are always a lot of things were you have to be cautious. ‘He’s a player that’s going to push to be really fast on the pitch… he’s progressing really well, he’s working really hard, he’s in the right place in terms of the time that we set for him, but he’s still a bit far.’ Jesus has helped transform Arsenal’s attack since joining from Manchester City in the summer.

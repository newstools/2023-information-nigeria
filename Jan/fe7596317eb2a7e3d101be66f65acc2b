Former aide to ex president Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has said that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar is transparent with everything about him. The popular author who said this in his 86th series on why he believes Atiku is the best choice for Nigerians, maintained such cannot be said of other presidential candidates because they have skeletons in their cupboard. Omokri disclosed that Atiku’s place of birth, parents, school, classmates and many other personal life are all in the public domain for anyone to see. His statement reads: “Day 86 of #WhyShouldIVoteAtiku: Transparency is the most important ingredient of leadership. And Waziri Atiku Abubakar is transparent. You know who his parents were, when and where he was born, where he schooled, and who were his classmates. Can you say the same for Bola Tinubu or Peter Obi?

While Ambassador Mabien Samadi testified that he was Waziri Atiku’s classmate at Provisional Secondary School, Yola, Peter Odili denied Peter Obi! “While Waziri Atiku Abubakar has provided over 30 different businesses to justify his wealth, Bola Tinubu, who said his parents were poor peasants, claimed to have inherited multimillion dollar real estate. From whom? “Whereas Peter Obi lied that he brought a company to employ 60% of Anambra’s population, Waziri Atiku’s Priam group of companies VERIFIABLY employs over 13,500 Nigerians in making made in Nigeria goods and services. He does not import to destroy local production. “And it is because Waziri Atiku Abubakar is more transparent than his rivals that I urge you and your family and friends to vote for him and the Peoples Democratic Party on Election Day, Saturday, February 25, 2022.”

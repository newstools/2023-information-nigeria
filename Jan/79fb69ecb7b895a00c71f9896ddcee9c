The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared that the world would watch Nigeria soar higher under the presidency of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the party’s presidential candidate in 2023, if elected. Director, Media and Publicity, Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Bayo Onanuga, made this known in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, adding that 2023 was a year of renewed hope and victory for Nigerians. Onanuga mentioned that Tinubu and Kashim Shettima, his Vice-Presidential running mate, had clearly laid out a grand vision for a better Nigeria in their action plan. “Let us seize this moment as we work to vote for the APC in the new year to continue the progressive governance we started over seven years ago. “We do this as we pray for the repose of those who could not make it in the conviction that their souls are resting in peace. “We also pray for those who might have gone through the year 2022 with some challenges that the new year will usher in great tidings,” he said. He binged on the significance of 2023 Nigerians because it would provide another opportunity to the people to exercise their inalienable rights to participate in making decisions over the country’s human and material resources. This, he said, was a duty that every citizen qualified to vote could not transfer to another person, adding that it is a responsibility that should not be exchanged for money. “It is a sacrifice for the consolidation of democracy and federalism, the sacred values of our Constitution.

Onanuga added that as we move from where we were to where we want to be, we needed to maximise our resources, feed ourselves with what we grow and give our youths education that will make them excel. He further said that we also needed to provide shelter for the homeless and bring constant electricity and technology to make production easier and convenient. “2023 is our chance to make these dreams come true, let us seize the moment,” Onanuga urged. Onanuga said the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari had tried its best in spite of its challenges, adding that it is like building a tarmac on a solid concrete foundation. “The coming administration of APC under the leadership of Tinubu and Sen. Kashim Shettima, his running mate, when elected, shall put an aeroplane on the tarmac already built by Buhari that will take us at supersonic speed to our destination. “The world shall watch Nigeria soar higher and higher. “Security, infrastructure, education, health, housing, tourism shall be transformed to provide jobs and boost the economy,” Onanuga said.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has urged leaders of faith in Nigeria to champion the course of justice that would deepen national unity and advance democracy ahead of the February 25, 2023 election. Tinubu also asked religious leaders to desist from efforts by some politicians to substitute sentiments with competence in the run-off to the election. A statement by the Tinubu Media Office on Monday said the APC candidate spoke on Sunday evening during a town hall meeting with Muslim leaders from the North East as part of his campaign tour to Bauchi State. “Our scriptures demand justice of us as believers. May we always honour that demand. “That principle of fairness and justice also requires that leadership of society should be based on the quality of one’s ideas, character and accomplishments, rather than on traits unrelated to the ability to lead and govern justly and honestly.

He did not confer special advantage to his own tribe, or clan. “In many instances, he placed others ahead of his own relatives. The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) has set a golden example for us,” the former Lagos State governor said. He stated that leaders of faith must act as pillars of unity, rather than agents of division. “Afraid they cannot win fairly at the ballot, desperate politicians are bent on recruiting otherwise eminent persons to preach hatred against discord. “They want servants of God like yourselves to turn against your own convictions. They want you to preach division and stir negative sentiments “Please resist these evil-doers and their unholy messages. They seek to enter office by fouling the nation. Too much is at stake to allow such tricks to succeed,” Tinubu said.

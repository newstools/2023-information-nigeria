Femi Fani-Kayode, a spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council (APC-PCC), has berated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over its suit challenging Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s presidential candidacy in the next month’s general elections. The PDP Presidential Campaign Organisation (PCO) had through its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, told reporters in Abuja on Monday, that PDP proceeded to the court to demand among other things, that Tinubu be declared “ineligible to contest the Presidential election by virtue of section 137 (1) (d) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).” He also disclosed that the PDP “is filing for accelerated hearing in this case in the interest of the nation.” However, Fani-Kayode, on Monday, condemned PDP’s move to seek Tinubu’s disqualification on Channels Television’s Politics Today, describing the claims as baseless.

He submitted that “This is a simple lie. Fallacious mendacity. Complete falsehood. He [Tinubu] was never convicted. The Americans themselves said that he was not indicted and neither was he convicted. “Yet, they keep bleating like little children about these things. There’s no basis in reality in it. It’s a very simple thing. For us, this a civic duty. “We need to be responsible and it is our duty to expose Atiku for what he really is and we will continue to do that. They have tried to respond by bringing all manner of insults, all manner of fake allegations without any credible evidence. “If you have that kind of evidence, present it before the public and let us see. Then we will consider what you’re saying. So, then stop throwing bricks where you have nothing inside them to carry weight.”

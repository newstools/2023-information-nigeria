The national leader of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chukwuma Soludo says the Labour Party’s (LP) flag bearer, Peter Obi may win the much expected presidential elections in Anambra State. The Anambra State governor, however, doubted the chances of his victory in the overall presidential election next month. “I wish Peter Obi the best of luck. Let him go and compete as others,” Soludo said on Channels Television’s Politics Today programme on Thursday. “We (APGA) are also competing in the same race. We have our own candidate (Peter Umeadi), who is also son of the soil, coincidentally from Anambra State as well, and he will do his own bit, get his own votes.” READ ALSO: Soludo Denies Alleged Removal Of Peter Obi’s Campaign Banner In Anambra Soludo, who is the governor of Anambra State, also referred to his piece in November 2022 where he said though Obi might win in Anambra but won’t win the overall presidential election. “In that piece, I even considered that Peter Obi might win in Anambra State. I did mention that,” he said but doubted the possibility of the LP presidential candidate to win the overall election. The APGA leader also said he has given Obi all the support a state government can offer to a former governor like Obi, who was in office between 2006 and 2014. However, the Anambra governor  said he has been fair to all parties campaigning in the state and has not denied them state facilities to use for rallies.

Some of the billboards of Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi in Anambra have been pulled down. The action was carried out over the alleged inability of Obi to pay the State Government. The bill boards mounted in strategic positions in some areas were removed by the Anambra Signage and Advertising Agency (ANSAA) at the weekend. But LP accused Governor Charles Soludo of ordering removal of the bill boards for ulterior motives.

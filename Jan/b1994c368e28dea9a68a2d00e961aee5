 Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has insisted that the candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, deserves the votes of all patriotic Nigerians, saying only the unpatriotic ones would vote for his opponents. Obasanjo urged Nigerians to vote for Obi, saying the reason was because he possesses good characters, which his fellow contestants lack. Obasanjo made this statement on Thursday in Abeokuta, the capital of Ogun State, during an interactive session hosted by the Experiential Leadership in Africa (TEL-Africa).

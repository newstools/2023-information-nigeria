According to him, the Nigerian leader had done more than any other to support democratic governments in West Africa, just as he had done in waging battles against the emergence of non-democratic regimes. “For this, said the ECOWAS Chairman, President Buhari will have his name on the Roll of Honor in the community’s new headquarters building upon its completion in Abuja, so that future generations of West African citizens will know about the greatness he achieved and to copy his laudable examples,” the statement read in part. In response, the President welcomed the proposition, stressing that democracy is a dependable vehicle for achieving national development because it unites diverse people and cultures. “Buhari will have his name on the roll of honor in the community’s new headquarters building upon its completion in Abuja,” a statement signed on Tuesday by the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, read. The statement is titled ‘ECOWAS to confer democracy icon award on President Buhari.’

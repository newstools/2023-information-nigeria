This came barely three weeks after some gunmen abducted two wives and five children of the Chief of Mutum-Biyu and later murdered them in the state. Family sources who spoke to The Punch said the armed men invaded the traditional ruler’s residents on Friday night in Serkin Kudu, when he was out of the house.

Abdullahi also said the arrested suspects are providing useful information to the police and efforts are on to rescue the victims and arrest the remaining suspects. “The gunmen are yet to establish contact with anybody. We pray for the safety of the victims. For now, they have not contacted us so we can’t talk about how much they are demanding for ransom. “None of the victim’s phone number is going through, but we are trusting God for their safety,” one of the family members told our correspondent in a telephone interview.

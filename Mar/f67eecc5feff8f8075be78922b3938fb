The All Progressives Congress (APC) has appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to do everything within its power to protect the data of the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) machines. The Party’s reaction is coming barely hours after INEC rescheduled the Governorship and State House of Assembly elections earlier slated for March 11 to March 18 so as to reconfigure the BVAS machines. Felix Morka, the APC National Publicity Secretary, in an issued statement on Thursday, also disclosed they the Party will abide by the decision of Commission. Morka said, “While noting its reassurance that data from the presidential and National Assembly elections will be properly backed up on its cloud facilities, we urge INEC to do everything within its power to preserve and protect the integrity of the extracted data from BVAS as it has committed to do before court.

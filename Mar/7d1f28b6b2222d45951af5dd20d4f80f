That’s crap. “Anambra is an Igbo land. “You can’t come into someone’s land and tell that person it’s now a no man’s land. “Na you dey find trouble. “Nobody can deny the fact that the Igbos have contributed immensely to the development of Lagos. “Other tribes have contributed in their own ways too. “And the Yorubas have been largely accommodating as well. “It shouldn’t take away the fact that Lagos is a Yoruba land. We no dey drag ownership. “Let’s kill tribalism before it kills us.” See post below:   A post shared by Yul Edochie (@yuledochie)

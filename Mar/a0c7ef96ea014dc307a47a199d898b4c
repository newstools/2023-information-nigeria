Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has arranged a legal team of 19 Senior Advocates of Nigeria to challenge the result of the February 25 election. Atiku addressed them on Wednesday at his campaign Headquarters in Abuja, asking them to “establish the claim of illegality in the election and reclaim the mandate of the Nigerian people.” The team is headed by a seasoned litigation and commercial lawyer, JK Gadzama. He further declared that it is crucial for them to go through this process not just for himself and PDP, but also to reinforce constitutional democracy and safeguard it for future generations.

They will also apprehend the suspects responsible for the killings.” “We are on top of the situation and all the hoodlums responsible would be rounded up.” “But for the timely intervention of joint security personnel coordinated by the Area Commander, the terrorists would have had a field day.” “Repelling  the hoodlums was a tedious task for our security agencies, but they were successful as the terrorists scampered away from the scene.” The police said they were confident their operatives would ensure a successful operation.

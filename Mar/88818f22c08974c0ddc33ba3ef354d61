The Former State chairman of the party, Ambrose Onyekwere confirmed the dissolution of his executive. He said: “It is normal as my tenure has expired.” However, some members and supporters of the party, have been worried over the sudden development, ten days before the governorship and state house of Assembly election. According to a top governorship aspirant, who did not want his name mentioned, he said: “The dissolution of the state executive should have come after the governorship and house of assembly elections. What does the labor party want to achieve by putting their people in confusion? They should have waited until after the election. There is a plot to hand over the governorship ticket to a money-bag aspirant.  We will resist that.

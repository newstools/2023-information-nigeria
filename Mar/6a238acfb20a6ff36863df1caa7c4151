The presidency on Monday said that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration should rather be commended for the remarkable improvement in the conduct of elections in the country instead of vilification. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has come under heavy attack over the alleged irregularities occasioned by the delay in uploading the Pulling Units results from the BVAS to the iREV immediately after collation. But the Presidency has frowned at the position taken by the international media, saying that the world had been treated to epic lies and hate, and told by global media to expect a different outcome. The Presidency in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu said Nigerians shocked the world by refusing religious hatred and sectarian politics.

No one has disputed the result of the election, except the candidates that fell short. The biggest and most competitive presidential election in the history of Nigeria has been won by one man: Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “The US State department congratulated President-elect Bola Tinubu of the governing All Progressives Congress, APC and the people of Nigeria on the outcome of the “competitive election.” “British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, was also quick to congratulate the winner, on this victory. And so did many others in ECOWAS and the African Union. “Though it is true there were some delays and technical faults in the process that we can learn from – as is the case in any election the world over – the vote progressed and consolidated democracy in Nigeria. “The integrity of the Electoral Act of 2022 was strengthened. The Bimodal Voter Accreditation System cut out ghost, unauthorised or multiple votes to stem fraud. “The election may not have been pluperfect, but due to the steps the government has taken, it is an improvement on previous polls. That achievement should not be overlooked. The next step is for the Election Commission to ensure transparency in collation.” It further said, “Adverse reactions as received from some quarters are themselves a part of the learning process for everyone. “Elsewhere, the world had been treated to epic lies, obfuscation, jingoism and hate, and told by global media to expect a different outcome. Nigerians shocked the world by refusing religious hatred and sectarian politics. “All true friends of Nigeria should join the people in proceeding forward for sustainable peace. “APC victory in the presidential election, underscored by the nationwide wave of support in the National Assembly results is clear mandate for the party to retain power for another term of four years. “This election is an improvement on past elections and due credit should be given to the government and people of this country.”

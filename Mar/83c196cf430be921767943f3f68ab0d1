Recall that the Central Bank of Nigeria had redesign the N200, N500 and N1,000 notes and banned the old notes but later accepted only the old N200 notes. However, the banks claimed that the new notes were not made available to them, hence many of them had to shut down while other worked skeletally or closed operations much earlier than usual. Their digital payment platforms were also non-operational as most bans’ USSD transfers, automated teller machine (ATM) were unavailable while there were no over-the-counter (OTC) operations.

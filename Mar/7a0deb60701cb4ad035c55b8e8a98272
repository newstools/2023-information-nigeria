The Kogi State government has ordered the arrest and prosecution of individuals and businesses in the State rejecting old naira notes. The order is coming after the Supreme Court ruled that both the old and new naira notes remain legal tenders until December 31, 2023. On Friday, the State’s government in a statement released through the Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo congratulated Nigerians on the ruling of the apex court. According to his statement, the governor Yahaya Bello administration joined other states in the suit filed against the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to ease the hardship occasioned by the unavailability of cash. Fanwo noted it was unacceptable that some persons and businesses continued to reject the old notes, even after the court validated their use.

Fanwo said, “Rejecting the old naira notes is a clear disobedience of the Supreme Court ruling. “Anyone who rejects the old naira notes should be reported to security and government authorities for immediate action. Also, banks that refuse to accept old naira deposits shall be sealed.” The commissioner warned that the government will not accommodate financial institutions “that willfully disobey court orders, moreso, the orders of the highest court in Nigeria. “Since the banks are issuing the old naira notes, they are bound to also receive it. We cannot continue to kill our economy after the Supreme Court has granted us freedom.”

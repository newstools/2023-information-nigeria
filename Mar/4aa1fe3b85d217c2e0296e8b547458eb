 The Plateau State Police Command has reacted to the news making the rounds on social media that a 19-year-old supporter of the Labour Party (LP) standard bearer, Peter Obi, committed suicide after Obi lost last Saturday’s presidential election. The State Police spokesperson, DSP Alabo Alfred, said the suicide story was fake and unfounded, explaining that it is capable of inciting political uproar in the state. Alabo stated this while addressing newsmen in Jos, the state capital.

Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has disclosed that it will support the re-election bid of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu State since he approved usage of hijab in Lagos schools for students. Disclosing this in a statement, Ishaq Akintola, the director of MURIC, said the governor’s score card revealed giant steps in critical areas. The statement read, “The people of Lagos state will join their counterparts from other states of the federation to exercise their franchise in a nationwide governorship election on Saturday, March 11. “It is our humble submission that Sanwo-Olu is the best option and we urge Lagosians, regardless of religious background, to give him their votes. “In his first four years, Sanwo-Olu has taken Lagos to the next level. His major achievements being the red and blue rail lines as well as the revamping of water transport with high capacity boats acquired by the Lagos State Ferry Services (LAGFERRY). “These are very significant steps, particularly for a mega city like Lagos with its perennial traffic congestion,” he said. According to Akintola, Sanwo-Olu’s administration also constructed more than 308 roads among which were the Pen Cinema flyover, Lekki-Epe-Ibeju road expansion and the Lekki-VGC regional road.

He further appealed to muslims in particular, to regard the governorship poll as an entirely different picture. “A vote for Sanwo-Olu is a vote for Tinubu, his mentor. “This time, muslims will vote for a christian, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. He deserves our votes because of his brilliant performance. “It may also be necessary to remind muslims in Lagos state that Sanwo-Olu gave instructions for the issuance of the hijab circular in the state. “We therefore implore the good people of Lagos to troop out en masse to vote for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu,” he said.

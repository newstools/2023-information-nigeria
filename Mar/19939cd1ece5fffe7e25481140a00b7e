The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has urged Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria’s president-elect, to prioritise academics in the country unlike how the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has been doing. The chairman of the academic union in Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, Gbolahan Bolarin, also admonished the former Lagos State governor to ensure that university education is treated with utmost respect. Bolarin said, “The first thing that one would expect from the next President is that university education must be a priority. No one should treat university education system with disdain that would make our students to stay at home for eight months because of governance failure.” “He cannot afford to treat academics like they are not humans the way the President is treating us,” he told The Punch.

 The Chief Judge of Ebonyi State, Justice Elvis Ngene, on Friday, restrained the police from arresting the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, Prof Benard Odoh over the murder of the Umuezeokoha traditional ruler, HRH (Eze) Igboke Ewa. The late monarch was reportedly murdered two weekâ€™s ago at his palace by unknown assassins.

However, in a case brought before the Abakaliki High Court 1 by his son, Prince Igboke Emeka against Odoh; Commissioner of Police; and the Inspector-General of Police, the applicant prayed the court for an order of mandate directing the CP and IGP to immediately arrest Odoh to answer to the allegation of his involvement in the murder of HRH Ewa. Counsel to APGA governorship candidate led by C.K. Okorie (SAN) challenged the jurisdiction of the court to hear the application. After hearing the motion for jurisdiction and the substantive suit, the court ordered that the police should first do a thorough and independent investigation into the complaint and if anybody is found culpable of the alleged murder, such person should be arrested. The court refused to order for his arrest as prayed by the applicants. Reacting to the ruling, one of the counsels to the 1st defendant, (Odoh), Sir Petrus Elechi, applauded the judgement of the court and appreciated the court for the sound judgement and for not allowing the court to be used as a tool for political witch-hunt. He expressed joy that the court stood on the path of the rule of law wherein it ordered that the police should carry out a thorough and independent investigation into the matter before staging the arrest of anyone found culpable.

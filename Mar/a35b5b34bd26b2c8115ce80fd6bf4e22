The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will appeal the court judgment that asked the umpire to accept the use of the Temporary Voters Card (TVC) in the coming elections. Responding on Twitter on Thursday via its verified handle @inecnigeria, the commission said: “INEC has been served a copy of the judgment delivered today (yesterday) by the Federal High Court, Abuja Division, which ordered it to allow two plaintiffs to vote with their Temporary Voter’s Card (TVC). “The commission is taking immediate steps to appeal against the judgment of the trial court.” Information Nigeria had reported a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered INEC to allow the use of TVCs in the March 18 governorship and state House of Assembly election.

Justice Egwuatu said the order was made on the grounds that the plaintiffs were duly registered and captured in INEC’s database. “An order is made compelling the defendant (INEC) to allow the plaintiffs to vote, using their Temporary Voter Cards issued by the defendant, the plaintiffs having been duly captured in the National Register of Voter’s database. “A declaration is made by this court that the plaintiffs, having fulfilled all necessary legal requirements to register and having consequently been captured in the defendant’s (INEC’s) central database and manual, printed paper-based record or hard copy format of the defendant’s maintained Register of Voters, the plaintiffs are entitled to vote using their Temporary Voter’s Cards in the forthcoming 2023 general election,” he said.

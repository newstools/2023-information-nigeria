Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has ordered the lifting of the ban on the use motorcycles in the Sankera axis of the state comprising Katsina-Ala, Ukum and Logo Local Government Areas, LGAs. The ban became effective in December 2020 after a resolution of the State Security Council, following the alarming increase in crimes perpetrated in that axis by armed men on motorcycles. According to a statement issued on Tuesday in Makurdi by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Nathaniel Ikyur, the lifting of the ban was with immediate effect. Ikyur in the statement said, “directive is in consonance with the judgment of the High Court of Justice, Gboko which had set aside the order of the Benue State Security Council who banned the use of motorcycles in the Sankera axis of the state as a way of curtailing the rise of crime in the area.

 The National Welfare Officer of the All Progressives Congress and a member of the National Working Committee, has been reported dead. Nwosu, a chieftain of the party, once contested Abia State governorship election on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party before defecting to the ruling APC. The late legal icon was said to have been admitted in an undisclosed health facility in the Federal Capital Territory before he was discharged on Wednesday. According to The Punch, Nwosu reportedly went back to the same hospital for a routine check up on Thursday where a source confirmed that he relapsed and had to be rushed into the intensive care unit where he gave up the ghost. “His death has jolted all the NWC members including the National Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu. I am sure the secretariat will release an official report tomorrow morning,” the source said.

The statement read, “RIP SIR F.N. NWOSU. Words are not enough to describe the monumental loss brought by the passing of the party’s National Welfare Secretary, Sir Friday Nwosu, on the APC family. May his soul rest in peace.” Nwosu’s last official assignment before the presidential and National Assembly elections was a press conference he held on February 10 where he appealed to former Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, and other disgruntled stakeholders to reconcile with Abia governorship candidate, Ikechi Emenike, to wrestle the state from the Peoples Democratic Party.

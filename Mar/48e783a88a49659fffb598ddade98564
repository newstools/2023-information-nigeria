Iba Gani Adams, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, has said the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, emerged as the president-elect due to his ‘doggedness and consistency in Nigerian politics.’ The disclosure was made in a congratulatory message to Tinubu, signed by Adam’s special assistant on media, Kehinde Aderemi, on Wednesday. According to him, Tinubu’s emergence was well-deserved because he has been consistent as a frontline politician that had fought tirelessly for the enthronement of Nigeria’s democracy.

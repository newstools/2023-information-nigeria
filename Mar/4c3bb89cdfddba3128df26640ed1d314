Atiku Abubakar, the flagbearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the protest the Party embarked upon, alongside leaders, members and supporters, at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to cancel the February 25 presidential election, will not stop until the Party is tended to. The PDP candidate had on Monday led aggrieved Party supporters to the INEC headquarters in Abuja to protest the outcome of the February 25 presidential election, which the Party’s standard bearer, claimed to have won. The electoral commission had declared the All Progressives Congress candidate, Bola Tinubu, the winner of the election after scoring a total of 8,794, 726 votes, but the PDP and LP denounced the result and vowed to challenge it in court. At the protest were the national chairman of the Party, Iyorchia Ayu; Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; his Taraba State counterpart, Darius Ishaku and other chieftains. The march also had in attendance a former national chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus; former House of Representatives member, Dino Melaye; a former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihediaha and former Adamawa State governor, Boni Haruna, among party chieftains. Atiku said, “All the provisions of the current electoral law have been completely contravened. We were protesting and then INEC was not listening and went on to announce the result. That is why we are protesting. We have the right to protest and it will continue for a very long time, either every day or any other day. We have the right to protest under the constitution, and it doesn’t stop us from going to the court.’’ Via a protest letter, the Party warned INEC against messing up the coming governorship and state houses of assembly elections. The letter was received on behalf of the INEC National Chairman, Mahmoud Yakubu, by the National Commissioner and Chairman Voter Education and Publicity, Festus Okoye. The PDP national chairman, Ayu, stated “We call on your commission to suspend the ongoing transmission of the polling units results to your servers which is in complete breach of the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022. “We reject and declare as unacceptable the outcome, announcement and declaration of the presidential election results.

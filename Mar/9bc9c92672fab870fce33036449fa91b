Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has urged his supporters not to turn the court premises into a protest ground when the presidential election tribunal commences. Peter Obi, who is on a verge to challenge the result of the Feb. 25 poll in court, made this known via his Twitter handle, as he asked his supporters not to congest the court premises. The Appeal Court will today hear the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) application seeking to set aside earlier order granted to both Obi and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to inspect the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) machines. Obi and Atiku had obtained the order of the Court to inspect INEC materials used during the presidential election.

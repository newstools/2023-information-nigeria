He insisted that he would pursue justice through court and was ready to challenge the results till he prove his argument. “Labour Party won the election and I will prove it,” Obi vowed. He added, “I will challenge this rascality for the future of the country”. The former governor said he believed the process through which people come into any position was important and there was a need for Nigeria to sanitise the process. “On this issue (presidential election) I am challenging the process,” Obi said. He said he had challenged several election results and come out victorious and he would be approaching the court with the firm belief of getting justice. “The court exists for this and they have asked me to go to court and I will be going to court,” the former governor added. Quipped on if he is under pressure, he said no one can put him under pressure for challenging the rascality. “We have to go through this darkness. The structure of criminality can’t go out overnight. “All we need to show is commitment and resilience. I will be at the forefront and will work through this darkness until the daybreak,” Obi vowed.

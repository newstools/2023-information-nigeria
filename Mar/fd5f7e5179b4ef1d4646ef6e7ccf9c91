Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has described as “false and malicious” reports that he introduced the naira redesign policy as a plot against Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the president-elect. According to the allegations filtering the media, Emefiele plotted with a “billionaire retired general” from the north and provided funds to Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivor, the governorship candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in Lagos state, to enable him defeat Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the incumbent. But in a statement issued on Monday, Isa Abdulmumin, CBN’s acting director of corporate communications, said Emefiele “does not take part in politics”.

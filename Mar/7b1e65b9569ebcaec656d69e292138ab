She said: “I met a 14-year-old girl wearing a short skirt and a crop top and working under another young guy on the movie set who claims to be a make-up artist. Her parents are far away in Port Harcourt, and she came to Lagos last year. She sleeps in different hotel rooms with whoever agrees to accommodate her every night and is unwilling to return to her parents. This girl told me that she is here to learn but trust me, I know the industry, and it is not a safe place for young girls.” She added that celebrities, and movie producers, should say no to child abuse and endeavor to keep the industry clean.

 The Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Adamawa State, Umar Mustapha, has announced his withdrawal from the race to support the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Aishatu Ahmad Binani. A few days to the presidential election, Mustapha had accused the LP of working against him, ditching its presidential candidate, Peter Obi and calling on his supporters to work for the then APC standard bearer, Bola Ahmad Tinubu instead. Addressing an APC stakeholders meeting on Sunday, Mustapha also known as Otumba, said he had finally decided to step down for Binani, with whom he said he shared the same passion for service to the people, in order to increase her chances.
